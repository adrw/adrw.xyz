# Buy

* Currency Devaluation: The risk of currency devaluation as a monetary tool to deleverage the extensive national debts brought on by COVID would result in on a nominal basis real asset prices like stocks, gold, houses, physical tools, and other goods rising. Without an inflation adjusted salaried job (primarily only available if unionized or working for government), cost of living and home price to wage ratios will continue to increases with the hope of modest salary adjustments upwards about as good as can be expected. The loss of purchasing power could be significant. Purchase of a home locks in housing prices at current nominal levels, and a currency devaluation results in you paying back the bank with less valuable dollars over time, which leaves you better off provided that the mortgage debt is in the same currency that your income is earned and you can maintain your income source through the inflationary period.
* Rent vs Buy: For a 3 bedroom house in Kitchener-Waterloo, rent runs on average from $2000-2500 and home prices from $500-900k depending on location and finish. With our personalized inputs based on a large down payment input into a Rent vs Buy calculator, our total throw away costs (mortgage interest + utilities + property tax + maintenance) for buying are near equivalent or lower than renting (rent + utilities).
* Minimal Cash Flow Difference to Renting with Smith Maneuver: The key insight of the Smith Maneuver isn't necessarily the common one of making your mortgage interest tax deductible, but getting to maintain higher leverage ratios and limit the use of cash flow to only go into the real estate asset class. This is done by having a readvanceable mortgage + HELOC where for each additional mortgage payment the principal amount increases the HELOC credit limit. You can then withdraw that amount from the HELOC and invest in the same way you would had you been renting and that cash flow had not gone to the mortgage payment.
* Long Term Asset to Borrow Against: Over time as your house builds equity, it becomes one of the few (see only for most people) assets that you can own and easily (and at low cost) borrow against through a HELOC or refinancing. After weeks of inquiries and research earlier in 2020, it became clear that nearly no bank wants to extend similar borrowing against asset lines of credit for other asset classes like a stock portfolio (most banks didn't offer it, some required physical paper share certificates, others had higher than usual transaction costs and limited trading abilities). Having house equity that can be borrowed against provides flexibility in the future to be your own bank and extend (via a bank) to yourself credit at the lowest rate around.
* Mortgage Improves Credit Score: Counter intuitively, taking on a lot of debt via mortgage often can increase your credit score, provided you make every payment on time, which makes it easier in the future to take on another mortgage for an investment property or other more productive forms of debt.
* Real Estate Price Appreciation: Given the current trend prompted by COVID of flight from big cities like Toronto to smaller cities and suburbs including Hamilton, Guelph, and Kitchener-Waterloo, continued price appreciation in these cities could buck forecasted downturns in 2021 since the forecasts are reporting on average national price movement which includes Alberta real estate (hit hard by drop in oil price) and major cities like Toronto and Vancouver which have had more drastic (and arguably less sustainable) price run ups in recent years, especially in condo markets (which now are the primary real estate class that have seen price drops).
* Capital Gains Tax Exemption: The gain on sale from a house price appreciating over time is still exempt from capital gains taxes in Canada, which for long term holding of real estate can have a significant effect on personal finances.
