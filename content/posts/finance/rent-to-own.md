While in university, an elderly friend of mine mentioned Rent-to-Own as an option as I wondered aloud about the steeply rising house prices in the area and whether that would be in our future.

I didn't look to closely into it until I recently stumbled across a number of videos from Matt McKeever digging into the model of Rent-to-Own with some RTO companies. The below is a summary of what I've learned as I've tried to better understand RTO and in what circumstances it is a good decision for a house purchaser, an investor, or when it leaves either high or dry.
