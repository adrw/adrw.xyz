I remember when I first saw the video below about intermittent fasting, it totally changed how I thought about healthy eating and I’ve been doing his recommended intermittent fasting since then and been feeling great from it.

Dr. Jason Fung is from Scarborough and has helped family of personal friends directly, and through his books other friends including a man in his 50s lose some excess weight, reduce their cholesterol, and reverse diabetes.

His main book is “The Obesity Code” and he has a new one called “The Diabetes Code”.
