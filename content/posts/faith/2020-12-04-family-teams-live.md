# Session 1: Decide (Jeremy Pryor)

What went wrong in the family?

- Culture
  - Problem: Family is too restrictive
  - Solution: Freedom
  - Men left the home, women should be allowed to too
- Christian Community
  - Problem: Family is distracted
  - Solution: Focus on the family
  - Jeremiah 6:16
- Jeremy, at 23, spent 4 months in Jerusalem to learn Hebrew and was shocked to see Dad's very present with kids, one time a flock of Dads walking around with strollers. What difference in values would cause men to do this?
- Until you get out of the water you're swimming in, you don't know what you're swimming in. Until he left western culture, he couldn't realize what was wrong with it.
- What these Jewish men saw that was different than the West was a single word: Abraham. All of their family values trace back to Abraham's value for family.
- Maybe we don't know what family *is*
- If God is the designer of family, it's possible that we've drifted so far that we can't understand the design of family. Jeremy thought Abraham's prayers for his descendents and his family were outdated and traditional.
- In the West, we think about parents that have a child, then they grow up and start new families. This kind of family has a memory of 80 years old. The reset button is hit every generation. 
- In the West, in numbers never before seen Dads leave the family. 60% of children now spend part of their childhood not in the home of their biological father.
- The classical family (Abrahamic) would start when a patriarc would cast a vision (we're going to move to this land, start this business, follow this God), the vision propels the family. The vision often takes generations to achieve. If they achieve that end, then the family has a legacy. They can tell a story that goes back generations of when we started down this road, the impact had. A family like this has a memory that can last 1000 years.
- How different are these two ideas of family? Consider Yitzach son of Asa vs Brad Johnson.
- Yitzach son of Asa (son in the first century)
	- Lives in a village, many siblings, owns acres of olive trees, fields, flocks, house, employ servants and employees. Home includes older sibling's married partner and kids, and older aunt.
	- Hero: Patriarc. Family legacy is 200 years ago patriarc who was brave, bought initial acres. Had to sell some to pay for taxes.
	- Son wants to grow up and become a tradesman, then build another room for his older sibling, buy more acres.
	- Biggest hope is that Messiah will return, restore justice to family, that home will be established forever, for peace in the land. 
	- Biggest fear is more taxes, have to sell land, name will be lost from Israel together.
- Brad Johnson
	- Lives in middle class Christian home, two siblings, Dad works as regional sales rep, Mom as preschool. Family and grandparents live separately.
	- Description of family: parents are nice, Dad does baseball, Mom helps with homework, younger sister is annoying.
	- Heros: Superman, sports star
	- Future: want to go professional in sports
	- Family accomplishment this year: maybe go on vacation, buy a new car
	- Personal accomplishment: become pitcher for team, make some more friends, ask a girl out
	- Biggest hope: sports team wins
	- Biggest fear: not scared of anything, if had to pick not having friends / being a nerd
- What is a modern family?
	- A springboard for individual success
	- Is everyone succeeding individually? Then we did our job
- What is the classical family?
	- A multigenerational team on mission
	- Abraham had a goal that he wanted his family to accomplish, it would take generations to accomplish, thus his family needed to work as a team to eventually accomplish this vision
	- New springboard family is a new idea, most other cultures are Abraham/classical
- Objectively, what is the family? As Christians, look at God's heart. What model springboard or classical best aligns with what we find in Scripture?
	- Best verse: Genesis 1. First time family was mentioned. "Subdue the world, bear fruit, rule"
	- Principle of first mention: first mention of a topic in the Bible often outlines the definition.
	- Primary goal of family is to bear fruit together, not individual fruit. Expand the boundaries of God's creation to cover the earth. 
	- God didn't create a company, a charity, etc. but a family; a mission that couldn't be accomplished in a single generation
- This is drastically different than springboard family.
	- Primary metaphor is the "nest". When kids grow up there's an "empty nest".
	- Purpose of nest is to nurture baby chicks. As soon as they're old enough, they should fly away and be on their own. Nothing wrong with autonomy and capabilities to function as an individual. But that's not what a family is. A family should work together, invest in each other.
	- Abraham would have thought of family as a team. We think of it as a nest.
- "I will make of you a great nation and I will bless you and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you and him who dishonours you I will curse, and in you all the families of the earth and be blessed." – Genesis 12:2-3
	- Notice the use of the word "you". Abraham only had one son. God was talking to "you" as the generational accomplishment.
	- Notice the goal, to bless all families of the earth. 
	- When we hear family, we think of Nuclear family (parents + kids). When Bible talks about family
- "Children are a gift from the Lord..." – Psalm 127:3-5
	- A lot of values here
	- Children are a gift, reward, exciting to have multiple families
	- Goal not to launch children out and start all over
	- Goal to build warriars for the multi-generational family line so Father won't be put to shame at the city gate
	- Modern culture treats family as recreation center. All productive activity is done individually.
	- In Psalm 127, family is the outpost. It's through the family that you accomplish things. It's militaristic.
	- Favourite picture of this is Lord of the Rings "Rivendell", archetypal family Enron is building a house by which things can be launched. "Rivendell was perfect whether you liked foor, or play, or work, or storytelling, or singing, or just sitting and thinking best, a pleasant mixture of them all. Evil things did not come into that valley"
- "But a widow has children or grandchildren, their first responsibility... [...] But those who won't care for their relatives, especially those in their own household..." – 1 Timothy 5:4,8
	- Feels like it's straight from the Torah. More verses there about caring for parents than there are for caring for children. Huge value. How you treat upstream generations matters in both Old and New Testament.
	- Paul says first responsibility is to care for upstream generations, first responsibility of the faith. We don't think of family like this anymore, never heard of a pastor preach through this before, "Before you serve in ministry, how are you serving the widows in your family?"
- Be Fruitful, then Multiply, then Rule
	- There is a process to building a family
	- How do you be fruitful? How do you experience love, peace, productivity in your family
	- Once fruitful, you can multiple to make more disciples as an outpost
	- Across generational strength, you can become a ruling family. This is the scriptural model given in Genesis
- Decide: Repent and Believe
	- What kind of family do you want to build? Springboard or multigenerational team on mission?
	- Which one is described by the Bible? Which excites your heart?
	- The Bible describes coming to a big decision as a process of "repent and believe". Change your mind. Don't first start doing lots of things, admit that your ideas are off. 
	- "God I don't think what I believed about family is what you called me to build. I repent and set that aside. I believe you've called me to build a multigenerational family team on mission"

# Session 2: Centering in on the Team (Jeff Bethke)
- Jeff grew up playing team sports competitively. What's interesting is how much team stuff translates to family. Sports and work have more organic team work, but family's at this point don't.
- Sports and work have a mission. 

## Two Misconceptions of Team
- Myth 1: The individual is going to get crushed. 
	- To that, Jeff says is facism. A team is the context in which an individual can flourish. This isn't the same as the Western context of individual success that is failing.
	- Note the 1 Corinithians context where the best self emerges from being on the right team and mutual improvement.
- Myth 2: If you're a team, you must always be around each other. Anything separate is not being a team.
	- Being a family team doesn't mean you're never apart. It's a spectrum. Always apart isn't great.
	- For example, in church sometimes the kids go to individual ministries. Other times in certain seasons everyone sticks together.
	- In some cases, a team member goes out as an ambassador for the family team. For example a parent going out to work to represent the family team. Yet, at times if the individual finds their identity at work or a separate activity, then that's not great.
	- Be what a team would be. You're together some times. Than you split for missional and contextual purposes.

## 5 Team Traits
- Every team has a coach
	- A coach, not two babysitters.
	- A coach takes ownership over the future of their team. A coach is not just trying to solve today, but to accomplish something for the future (day, week, month, year)
	- A babysitter is only to ensure safety and comfort for today
	- A coach meets those basic standards but is focused on the future, not just today
	- How do you as a parent corret, teach, discipline, have fun, engage with your kids to craft a future? Or is it simply to plug the holes today?
	- A coach takes ownership, whatever a team is like it falls on me.
	- A coach trains. A babysitter is reactive. A coach is proactive towards a future to obtain by God's guidance, spirit, and grace.
	- Can you say you're a coach? There's always areas to improve from babysitter to coach.
- Every team has a playbook
	- In general, every workplace and team culture has a playbook for how it operates
	- Culture can sometimes be caught, not taught. If parents are angry, then anger is learned.
	- What is the culture we want in our home? What are some mechanisms we can bake into our day, week, year that will reinforce the culture regularly?
	- Shabbat is so we have 500+ shabbats over 15 years and reinforce rhythms, rest...etc
	- Jeff would get frustrated with Kinsley for expectations that he never had mentioned. Talk about the playbook and hold yourself and others accountable. How do you deal with disagreements? How do you deal with money? When kids feel that the parents are accountable to the same playbook they are, it can be powerful.
- Every team has practices & games
	- Being a family team with toddlers doesn't feel as big or exciting. You're not taking your family on drastic mission, but in a way you are. 
	- Try and identify seasons in which to define practices & games. This 3 month period, our practice/game is taking each week dinner to a family for example. Or maybe the games are hospitality, that someone feels shalom when they enter the house.
	- A plumber at Jeff's once gave the best compliment, "I went slow and wanted to stay longer because it was so peaceful and restful to be here." The kids asked him questions about plumbing, they offered him coffee, water, cookies. Those are the games.
	- But, you need practices for that: meals when no one comes over that you practice asking questions etc. The kids need to understand the value of both the practices & the games.
	- Celebrate the wins, lowest hanging fruit in celebrating accomplishing and improving as a team
- Every team has rituals & traditions
	- Certain teams had certain hand shakes, or secret words. One tradition was a Jesus loving coach who had a big sleepover at the coach's house. If you weren't on varsity, you looked forward to. If you were, you enjoyed it.
	- Shabbat is a great one
	- Weekly movie night. Provide a specific context for screens, not just each on their own iPad. If family movie night is very intentional screen time together, it's not a crutch.
	- If you want your family to be fun, bless others, be spontaneous, what rituals can you build to support those values?
	- Give your values vehicles. What's something you can do over and over again to live out and practice your values.
- Every team has a mission
	- Where are you going? Can your family answer that?
	- Spend the next few weeks and beginning of 2021, seek the Lord's face to know what unique talents have been gifted to accomplish a mission for the kingdom.
	- God brought your family uniquely together with all your talents, perculiarities, shortcomings, strenghts, story, trajectory, together as a unit of the Kingdom of God in your neighbourhood and in other people's lives.
	- What's a word? What are your pillars? My family is hospitality. My family starts businesses. My family serves.
	- For example, one family with adult kids. Jeff texted the Dad some questions about electrician, he said "don't worry I'll come over now, do it for you and teach you". The entire family came over, the Dad and apprentice son got to work, the Mom hopped in the kitchen and started cooking. High relational care was their bulls eye. It blew Jeff's socks off and was something he wanted their family to become.

Try and develop the above for your family team!

# Session 2: Clarifying the Vision, Mission, and Pillars for your Family (Jeremy Pryor)

- Dreaming process about the future to develop your mission can work well with thinking more about narratives than pure pillars or principles. 
- Proverbs 9:1,5-6. Wisdom is a house built on 7 pillars. Motivated family pillars.
- Write independently a short phrase or a word and a matching descriptive sentence. Listen openly without feedback each person's pillars they wrote, then rank to narrow in on the top 7 (or whatever number you want). 
- Don't worry about this being set in stone, you can edit and refocus your pillars over time. Doing this hard work to define an aim for your team is pivotal.

# Session 2.5: All Kids Panel


# Session 3: Kids & Rhythmic Living Panel
- Kelsey's first memory of rhythms was planning notebooks and rewards when they were able to stick with a daily plan. Jackson (her brother) didn't like it as much so they found different patterns later.
- Rhythms have looked different through the years.
- Whatever you do throughout your week becomes your identity.
- Kelsey had lots of interests growing up but the ones that weren't part of a week didn't become her identity. She sews multiple times a week, and is a "sewist"; she loves painting but doesn't consider herself a painter since it doesn't happen once a week.
- She doesn't like having a time slot for a specific task; not 30 minutes for literature. She liked a large school block and then doing highest priority throughout that block.
- Jeremy: Some need well regimented schedule by the 15 or 30 mins. Others don't and larger blocks work better.

# Session 3: Team, Time, Table
- 3 tools to build a family team
- Time is a big deal. Families feel exhausted. When we say "it's important to be a team", it can feel like just another thing to add to your exhausted schedule.
- It's one of the greatest creation of how to fit in all the key things for your life.
- What's that amazing invention? It's called the 7 day week.
- Do you know your ideal week? If you knew how to piece together all that you are, your family relationships, all you need to accomplish outside the family, all the fun things, what does that look like?
- It looks different in different seasons, like with young kids but still is powerful.
- This doesn't look religious.
	- Luke 11:46, Jesus speaks out against the religious burdens put on by the religious leaders.
	- Think of all the religious pushes that can come through different sermons: great prayer life, go to church early, serve the poor, focus on the family...etc and how overwhelming that is to have endless lists to do
- A week causes you to make really hard trade offs so you don't find yourself in the frantic burnout that can happen so inevitably.
- The week is fascinating. It doesn't exist like other time segments. Moon => Month. Sun => Day. Rotation around the sun => Year.
	- God said, "Let there be lights in the dome of the sky to divide the day from the night; let them be for signs, seasons, days and years"  – Genesis 1:14
	- Other cultures have tried non-7 day weeks. See the French Revolution. People got sicker and very soon after the society reverted back to 7 days.
- Aim towards an ideal week, we have an entire lifetime to iterate towards one.
- God gave us the pattern of the 7 day week.
	- "You have 6 days to labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Shabbat... For in 6 days, Adonai made heaven and earth, the sea and everything in them; but on the seventh day he reseted." – Exodus 20:9-11
	- The Jews were slaves, working all 7 days. God called them into Shabbat to be free in rest.
- Three views of life
	- Linear: Western people look far into the future thinking constantly about a peak moment in their life: graduation, promotion, getting married...etc and burn through weeks. Think about Western narratives: Joe grew up, moved here, found themself. West are consumed with endless doing.
	- Circular: Eastern people see life very cyclically, seasons, life is monotonous. 
	- Spiral: Biblical weeks look like circular rhythms yet still with forward progress. 
- Rhythms vs Goals
	- What if you set 50 goals? What can stop or constrain you if these goals are overwhelming and realistic in the timeframe that you're living into.
	- Families and children aren't as suscpetible to having obvious goals like a career is. If you get excited by big goals, then your relationships can suffer when you focus on easy outlets for your goal achievement.
	- Rhythms may not have the same peak feeling of goal achievement but they let you reinforce your identity by putting it into practice every week.
- Identity > Rhythms > Improve
	- Start with who you are: father, husband, worker...
	- Build your rhythms to weekly reinforce your identity
	- Each week, iterate on your rhythms to make them more effective
- Think about a famous author who spoke at a conference, someone came up to them after the talk and said "Oh, I'm also a writer." The author asked the person, when did you last write? Well not today. What about yesterday? Well not then. And back and back until all 7 days. Well you're not a writer if you don't write in 7 days.
	- This is heavy but powerful.
