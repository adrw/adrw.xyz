**2016 | Chris Voss**

Written by a FBI hostage negotiator. In his first days of a executive negotiations training course at Harvard schooled the entire room using FBI tactics that worked in the field vastly better than the theory taught in MBA classes.

Voss intersperces his techniques with stories from the field and from personal life of how he has negtiated successfully and sometimes failed to achieve the desired outcome.

### Tone of Voice

Tone of voice matters. For hostage and intense negotations, he often goes with a midnight DJ smooth baritone tone that exudes calmness, confidence, and omniprescence. An aggressive posture and tone as recommended in many negotiating seminars may "get to yes", but that yes will simply be so you shut up and go away.

### Mirroring

Mirroring is the tactic of repeating back 2-3 words from what the other person recently said to encourage them to keep talking. The mirroring shows that you are listening but also often is convincing for the other persons' unconcious empathy judgement into thinking that you are not a threat. This makes the other person much more open to negotiating in good faith and trusting what you are saying.

### Silence

Silence is a secret tactic. Leaving time for a statement or question to sit puts unconscious social pressure on the other person to respond. When used in interrogations, people in periods of awkward silence can often end up rambling and sometimes fully confessing simply to stop the awkward encounter. During negotiations, using silence gives the other person the chance to actually listen to what you said above the noise of you talking, them trying to process your words, and their inner voice.

Additionally, the uncomfortbility of silence implies that you are unwilling to budge on a given term. Your counterpart will now start negotiating against themself to back down enough to get out of the situation amicably, doing the hard work of the negotiation for you!

### Anchoring

People _anchor_ to the first piece of data encountered. For example, if the price starts high, any offers are generally made relative to it. Low-balling to what the actual price might be can often be seen as unfair and is naively avoided.

Anchoring also can be used to prepare someone for an offer that at first listen would not be considered. But, when the initial offer presented is so awful, then the follow up "concession" (the actual offer) can be seen as a great compromise and worth taking.

### That's Right

"That's right", means they agree. "You're right", means they have tuned you out and just want to exit the conversation.

### Don't Split the Difference

Don't split the difference. Compromise and accepting worse deals is a tactic for feelings or discomfort minimization, not good negotiating.

### Deadlines

Deadlines cause people to do many things against the best interest and to rush a situation. Across countless private industry clients of Voss, only one example over decades could be given of a real deadline. Almost all are fake and with minimal blowback if it is missed, and thus a tool to imply deadlines for counterparts and not to get frantic yourself.

### The "F" Word

Use and be aware of the emotional power of the "F" word: _fair_. People intuitively do not want to be seen as being unfair. Starting the negotiation stating that you want to operate the negotiations fairly and using the word to describe the deal you're presenting puts the moral quandry on the other person. Similarly if they complain of a deal not being fair, and you're not aware of this potentially unconscious tactic, you can easily end up providing irrational concessions to be seen as _fair_ in the eyes of the other party.

### Loss Aversion

People naturally avoid loss. If competition can be presented amongst bidders and offers anchored low, often bidders will accept a much worse offer than if presented flat out due to not wanting to lose even the low bid to someone else.

### Don't Always Go First to Anchor

For monetary negotiations, generally having the other party make the first offer is the best tactic. In other cases, going first to anchor can still be advantageous.

In salary negotiations, for example, letting the employer anchor first can prevent you from unknowingly making an initial offer lower than what their initial offer would be.

In cases where you have the knowledge advantage or are the employer, you can often get away with lowballing and setting an extreme anchor. Or, if sides are equal in knowledge, throwing out a reasonable offer can make the negotiations go faster.

Yet, your reputation of fairness lingers long after the deal is struck. A history of lowballing employees or customers from a point of power will limit future deals as others see you as predatory.

### Anchoring Using a Range

When returning with a counter-offer, using a range for the monetary value of previous deals or what would be fair (obviously set optimistically) can draw the counter party towards not negotiating any lower than your lower bound, as to not seem unfair.

Studies show even exposure to an extreme anchor adjusts the willingness of the counter party in that direction, sometimes even to their maximum offer.

For example, a new hire at a job where the employer goes in wanting to pay $125k could bring up in the negotiations that "Well, I know that at ABC Corp, they pay similarly qualified new grads $130-170k". This doesn't come off aggresive or put the employer in a defensive position but moves their anchor up.
