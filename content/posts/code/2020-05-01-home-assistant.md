I've been curious about ways to do IoT and smart home without accepting the surveillance, hacking, and privacy intrusion of suspect companies like Nest or potentially incompetent implementations from legacy thermostat or camera manufacturers.

I think Home Assistant might be the trick. Self hosted smart home server with a huge community of maintained integrations for cameras, themostats, and more.
