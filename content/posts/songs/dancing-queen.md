[Intro]
A-D/A-A-D/A-A-D/A-A-D/A

[Verse]
A                                D/A  A                           F#m
Friday night and the lights are low,  looking out for a place to go
E                         A/E    E                  A/E
where they play the right music, getting in the swing,
            E    F#m            E    F#m
you come to look for a king.
A                      D/A   A                          F#m
Anybody could be that guy,   night is young and music's high.
E                  A/E   E              A/E
With a bit of rock music everything is fine
              E    F#m          E    F#m
You're in the mood for a dance.
             Bm7             E7
And when you get the chance

[Chorus]
            A              D/A                   A             D/A
You are the dancing queen, young and sweet, only seventeen.
A              D/A                    A          E/G#  D/F#m   A/E
Dancing queen, feel the beat from the tambourine.
E              C#7           F#m                      B7/D#
You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life.
D              Bm7               E7/B       A
See that girl, watch that scene, dig in the dancing queen.

[Verse]
A                                D/A  A                           F#m
You're a teaser, you turn 'em on,
E                         A/E    E                  A/E
leave 'em burning and then you're gone,
            E    F#m            E    F#m
looking out for another, anyone will do,
              E    F#m          E    F#m
you're in the mood for a dance.
             Bm7             E7
And when you get the chance...
