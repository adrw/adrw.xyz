[Verse]
Ebm                  Bb
Last night I had the strangest dream
Dm                     C
I sailed away to China in a little rowboat to find ya
Ebm                              Bb
And you said you had to get your laundry clean
Dm                              C    C    C    C
Didn’t want no one to hold you, what does that mean
And you said

[Chorus]
F                    Bb         C
Ain’t nothing gonna break my stride
Am             Dm  C  Bb
Nobody gonna slow me down, oh, no
Bb                  Dm C
I’ve got to keep on moving
F                    Bb         C
Ain’t nothing gonna break my stride
Am               Dm    C     Bb
Im runnin and I won’t touch ground, oh, no
Bb                  Dm C
I’ve got to keep on moving

[Verse]
Ebm                          Bb
You’re on the road and now you pray it lasts
Dm                           C
The road behind was rocky, but now you’re feeling cocky
Ebm                    Bb
You look at me and you see your past
Dm                            C
Is that the reason why you’re runnin’ so fast
And she said

[Chorus]
F                    Bb         C
Ain’t nothing gonna break my stride
Am             Dm  C  Bb
Nobody gonna slow me down, oh, no
Bb                  Dm C
I’ve got to keep on moving
F                    Bb         C
Ain’t nothing gonna break my stride
Am               Dm    C     Bb
Im runnin and I won’t touch ground, oh, no
Bb                  Dm C
I’ve got to keep on moving
