	   Em	          A	D
Well we're living here in Allentown
		Am		D	G
And they're closing all the factories down
	Em               A	Bm
Out in Bethlehem they're killing time
  A	      G 	D/F#	D/A - A
Filling out forms - Standing in line


	     Em			A		D
Well our fathers fought the Second World War
		Am		    D	G
Spent their weekends on the Jersey Shore
	     Em		A   Bm
Met our mothers in the USO
    A		G		D/F#	D/A - A
Asked them to dance, Danced with them slow
	Em	    A		D
And we're living here in Allentown


	F/A		G/B		C
But the restlessness was handed down
	Am		D	Em	G/B  C  D
And it's getting very hard to stay


C D G/B 2x
C D G-Gsus4-G


		Em	   A	  D
Well we're waiting here in Allentown
		Am	D	G
For the Pennsylvania we never found
	Em		A	Bm
For the promises our teachers gave
  A	      G	    D/F#	 A
If we worked hard , If we behaved


     Em		   A		D
So the graduations hang on the wall
	Am	       D	   G
But they never really helped us at all
	     Em		A 	 Bm
No they never taught us what was real
    A		G	D/F# 	    A
Iron and coke - And chromium steel


	Em           A		D
And we're waiting here in Allentown
	F/A		G/B		C
But they've taken all the coal from the ground
	Am		D	Em	G/B  C  D
And the union people crawled away


C D G/B C D


F		G/F		F
Every child had a pretty good shot
F		G/F		Bb/F
To get at least as far as their old man got
F		G/F		F
But something happened on the way to that place
F		G/F
They threw an American flag in our face

C D G Gsus4 G


	Em	    A		D
Well I'm living here in Allentown
		F/A		G/B	C
And it's hard to keep a good man down
	Am		D	Em	G/B  C  D
But I won't be getting up today   -  ay  -  ay
