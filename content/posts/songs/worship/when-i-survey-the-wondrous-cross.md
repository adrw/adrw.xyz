[Verse 1]
D                 G        D
When I survey the wondrous cross
D            G         D     A
On which the prince of glory died,
D                 G         D
My richest gain I count but loss,
D        Bm           A7     D
And pour contempt on all my pride.

[Verse 2]
D                     G        D
Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
D           G        D         A
Save in the death of Christ my God!
D                        G        D
All the vain things that charm me most,
D      Bm         A7     D
I sacrifice them to His blood.

[Verse 3]
D                      G          D
See from his head, His hands, His feet,
D          G         D       A
Sorrow and love flow mingled down.
D                      G      D
Did e’er such love and sorrow meet,
D         Bm          A7     D
Or thorns compose so rich a crown.

[Verse 4]
D                       G      D
Were the whole realm of nature mine,
D            G         D      A
That were an of-f’ring far to small.
D               G    D
Love so amazing so divine,
D          Bm        A7       D
Demands my soul, my life, my all.
