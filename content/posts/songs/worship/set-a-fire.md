[Intro]
C F Am F


[Verse]
C
No place I would rather be
F
No place I would rather be
Am
No place I would rather be
F
Than here in your love,
Here in your love


[Chorus]
C
Set a fire down in my soul
F
That I can't contain,
That I can't control
Am
I want more of you God
F
I want more of you God


[Bridge]
C
I want more
I want more
F
I want more
I want more
Am
I want more
Won't you
F
Pour it out


[Outro]
C F Am F
