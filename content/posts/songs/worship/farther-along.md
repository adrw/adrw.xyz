Capo 2nd Fret.

[Intro]
G  Cadd9  Em7  D

[Chorus]
G           Cadd9      Em7               D
Farther along well know all about it
G           Cadd9      Em7               D
Farther along well understand why
G                 Cadd9     Em7          D
Cheer up my brothers, live in the sunshine
G            Cadd9         Em7           D
Well understand this, all by and by

[Verse 1]
G
Tempted and tried, I wondered why
       Cadd9
The good man died, the bad man thrives
       Em7                              D
And Jesus cries because he loves em both

Were all cast-aways in need of ropes
G                                         Cadd9
Hangin on by the last threads of our hope
                                Em7
In a house of mirrors full of smoke
                             D
Confusing illusions Ive seen

 G
Where did I go wrong, I sang along
       Cadd9
To every chorus of the song
              Em7
That the devil wrote like a piper at the gates
D                                               G
Leading mice and men down to their fates
                                Cadd9
But some will courageously escape
                                        Em7
The seductive voice with a heart of faith
                           D
While walkin that line back home

                          G
So much more to life than weve been told
          Cadd9
Its full of beauty that will unfold
       Em7                              D
And shine like you struck gold my wayward son
                                                 G
That deadweight burden weighs a ton
                                     Cadd9
Go down into the river and let it run
                                           Em7
And wash away all the things youve done
                 D
Forgiveness alright

[Chorus]
G           Cadd9      Em7               D
Farther along well know all about it
G           Cadd9      Em7               D
Farther along well understand why
G                 Cadd9     Em7          D
Cheer up my brothers, live in the sunshine
G            Cadd9         Em7           D
Well understand this, all by and by

[Instrumental]
G  Cadd9  Em7  D

[Verse 2]
G
Still I get hard pressed on every side
                 Cadd9
Between the rock and a compromise
             Em7                                D
Like the truth and pack of lies fightin for my soul
                                 G
And Ive got no place left go
                                                Cadd9
Cause I got changed by what Ive been shown
                                     Em7
More glory than the world has known
                            D
Keeps me ramblin on

                  G
Skipping like a calf loosed from its stall
      Cadd9
Im free to love once and for all
       Em7                                      D
And even when I fall Ill get back up
                                           G
For the joy that overflows my cup
                                             Cadd9
Heaven filled me with more than enough
                                       Em7
Broke down my levee and my bluff
                        D
Let the flood wash me

G
And one day when the sky rolls back on us
Cadd9
Some rejoice and the others fuss
Em7                                     D
Cause every knee must bow and tongue confess

That the son of god is forever blessed
G                                             Cadd9
His is the kingdom, were the guests
                                         Em7
So put your voice up to the test
                             D
Sing Lord, come soon

[Chorus]
G           Cadd9      Em7              D
Farther along well know all about it
G           Cadd9      Em7              D
Farther along well understand why
G                 Cadd9     Em7         D
Cheer up my brothers, live in the sunshine
G            Cadd9         Em7          D
Well understand this, all by and by
