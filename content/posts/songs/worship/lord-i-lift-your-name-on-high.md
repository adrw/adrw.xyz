[Verse]
G         C                 D    C
 Lord, I lift Your name on high
G         C                  D
 Lord, I love to sing Your praises
G        C                 D   C
 I'm so glad You're in my life
G        C                D
 I'm so glad You came to save us.


[Chorus]
G                C         D
 You came from heaven to earth
      C     G
 To show the way
            C            D
 From the earth to the cross
     C      G
 My debt to pay
           C           D
 From the cross to the grave
           B7            Em
 From the grave to the sky
         Am7       D       G    C   G   Dsus D
 Lord, I lift Your name on high.
