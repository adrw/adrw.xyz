    G                 Am    G  C
How deep the Father's love for us
    G               Em  D
How vast beyond all measure
     G                 Am  G  C
That He should give His only Son
    G                 D   G
And make a wretch His treasure


    G                 Am   G   C
How great the pain of searing loss
    G                Em   D
The Father turns His face away
   G                    Am  G  C
As wounds which mar the Chosen One
       G           D  G
Bring many sons to glory


  G             Am   G   C
Behold the Man upon the cross
    G           Em   D
My sin upon His shoulders
   G               Am  G    C
Ashamed to hear my mocking voice
      G             D  G
Call out among the scoffers


   G               Am   G   C
It was my sin that held Him there
  G             Em  D
Until it was accomplished
     G               Am      G  C
His dying breath has brought me life
   G               D  G
I know that it is finished


-- (Key Change) --


   A                Bm  A  D
I will not boast in anything
    A                 F#m  E
No gifts, no power, no wisdom
    A               Bm  A   D
But I will boast in Jesus Christ
    A              E  A
His death and resurrection


      A                Bm  A  D
Why should I gain from His reward?
   A            F#m  E
I cannot give an answer
    A                Bm  A   D
But this I know with all my heart
    A                   E  A
His wounds have paid my ransom [x2]
