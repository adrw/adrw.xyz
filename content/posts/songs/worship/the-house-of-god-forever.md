It would have been hard to write it out with the chords so I'll just say it here.  When
play the C or F in the Intro or Verses you're going to want to play them like this
ons between C & Csus2 or F & Fsus2)...

Ex. (Note: Listen to song to get the rhythm)

[Intro]
C F C F


[Verse 1]
C         F
God is my Shepherd
           C                   F
I won’t be wanting, I won’t be wanting
C           F
He makes me rest
             C                 F
In fields of green, with quite streams
C             F
Even though I walk
            C                    F
Through the valley, of death and dying
C          F
I will not fear
              C                F
Cause You are with me, You are with me


[Chorus]
Gsus2           F
Your Shepherd’s staff

Comforts me
Gsus2      F
You are my feast

In the presence of enemies
Gsus2  F
Surely goodness
              Am          F
Will follow me, follow me
                    C       F  C  F
In the house of God forever


[Verse 2]
C         F
God is my Shepherd
           C                   F
I won’t be wanting, I won’t be wanting
C           F
He makes me rest
             C                 F
In fields of green, with quite streams
C             F
Even though I walk
            C                    F
Through the valley, of death and dying
C          F
I will not fear
              C                F
Cause You are with me, You are with me


[Chorus]
Gsus2           F
Your Shepherd’s staff

Comforts me
Gsus2      F
You are my feast

In the presence of enemies
Gsus2  F
Surely goodness
              Am          F
Will follow me, follow me
                    C       F  C  F
In the house of God forever
