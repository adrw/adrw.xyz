Capo 1

[Verse 1]
Am         C    G           F        Am    C
Beautiful God, Laying Your majesty aside
     G              F               Am    C
You reached out in love to show me life
 G           F             Am    C    G
Lifted from darkness into light, Oh


[Verse 2]
Am         C    G           F        Am    C
King for a slave, Trading Your righteousness for shame
     G              F               Am    C
Despite all my pride and foolish ways
 G           F             Am    C    G
Caught in Your infinite embrace, Oh


[Chorus]
    F  C           G           F
And I find myself here on my knees again
 C             G           F
Caught up in grace like an avalanche
 C          G             Am    G     F                   Am
Nothing compares to this love, love, love, Burning in my heart


[Verse 3]
Am         C    G           F        Am    C
Saviour and Friend, Breathing Your life into my heart
     G              F               Am    C
Your word is the lamp unto my path
 G           F             Am    C    G
Forever Iâ€™m humbled by Your love, Oh


[Chorus]
    F  C           G           F
And I find myself here on my knees again
 C             G           F
Caught up in grace like an avalanche
 C          G             Am    G     F                   Am
Nothing compares to this love, love, love, Burning in my heart


[Instrumental]
Am G C F


[Bridge]
 Am            G   C                   F                    C    G
Take my life, Take all that I am, With all that I am I will love You
 Am             G   C                 F            C    G
Take my heart, Take all that I have, Jesus how I adore You
