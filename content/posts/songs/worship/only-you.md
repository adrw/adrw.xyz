[Intro]
C  G Am F


[Verse 1]
C                 G                    Am
     Take my heart, I Lay it down
           F                            C
At the feet of you whose crowned
               G                       Am
Take my life, I’m letting go
           F                           C
I lift it up to You who’s throned


[Brake]
C  G  Am  F


[Chorus]
C             G            Am                 F
     And I will worship You, Lord only You, Lord
C             G            Am                       F
     And I will bow down before You only You Lord

[Verse 2]
C                 G                    Am
Take my fret, take my fear
           F                            C
All I have, I’m leaving here
               G                       Am
Be all my hopes, be all my dreams
           F                           C
You're my delights, be my everything


[Chorus]
C             G            Am                 F
     And I will worship You, Lord only You, Lord
C             G            Am                       F
     And I will bow down before You only You Lord
C             G            Am                 F
     And I will worship You, Lord only You, Lord
C             G            Am                       F

     Only you and me here now
