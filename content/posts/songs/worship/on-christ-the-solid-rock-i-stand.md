Capo 2

[Verse]
D                   Asus    A
My hope is built on nothing less
     G                A        D   Dsus
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness
           A
I dare not trust the sweetest frame
    G              A      D
But wholly lean on Jesus' name


[Chorus]
D                   G
On Christ the solid rock I stand
    D               Asus    A
All other ground is sinking sand
    D               A       D   D/F# G2 D2 D/F# G2 D
All other ground is sinking sand


[Verse]
D                       Asus   A
When darkness veils his lovely face
  G              A       D    Dsus
I rest on his unchanging grace
         A
In every high and stormy gale
   G            A          D
My anchor holds within the veil

[Chorus]
D                   G
On Christ the solid rock I stand
    D               Asus    A
All other ground is sinking sand
    D               A       D   D/F# G2 D2 D/F# G2 D
All other ground is sinking sand


[Verse]
D                       Asus A
His oath, his covenant, his blood
   G               A        D    Dsus
Supports me in the whelming flood
                A
When all around my soul gives way
   G              A        D
He then is all my hope and stay


[Chorus]
D                   G
On Christ the solid rock I stand
    D               Asus    A
All other ground is sinking sand
    D               A       D   D/F# G2 D2 D/F# G2 D
All other ground is sinking sand


[Verse]
D                       Asus    A
When He shall call with trumpet sound
   G             A      D    Dsus
Oh may I then in him be found
               A
Dressed In his righteousness alone
     G               A        D
Faultless to stand before the throne


[Chorus]
D                   G
On Christ the solid rock I stand
    D               Asus    A
All other ground is sinking sand
    D               A       D   D/F# G2 D2 D/F# G2 D
All other ground is sinking sand
