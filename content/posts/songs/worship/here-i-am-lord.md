G        Em     Am       D
 I, the Lord of sea and sky,
G       Em    Am        D
 I have heard my people cry.
G        Em       C        Am
 All who dwell in dark and sin,
              D
 My hand will save.

Chorus
       G   Em   Am       D7    G   Em   Am
Here I am, Lord.         Is it I,   Lord?
D7      G     Em  C       Am         D
 I have heard you calling in the night.
       G  Em   Am        D7     G   Em  Am
I will go, Lord,         if you lead me.
D7       G    Em   Am     D7     G  Em  Am  D7
  I will hold your people in my   heart.

V2:  I, who made the stars of night,
I will make their darkness bright.
Who will bear my light to them?
Whom shall I send?

V3: I, the Lord of snow and rain,
I have borne my people's pain.
I have wept for love of them.
They turn away.

V4: I will break their hearts of stone,
Give them hearts for love alone.
I will speak my words to them.
Whom shall I send?

V5: I, the Lord of wind and flame,
I will send the poor and lame.
I will set a feast for them.
My hand will save.

V6: Finest bread I will provide,
'Til their hearts be satisfied.
I will give my life to them.
Whom shall I send?
