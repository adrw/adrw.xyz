D                    Bm      A
All creatures of our God and King,
D                      Bm      A    A/G
Lift up your voice and with us sing,
D/F# G D    Bm   E A
Alle-luia!  Alleluia!
D            Bm              A
Thou burning sun with golden beam,
D           Bm               A
Thou silver moon with softer gleam!
G A      D    Em (D/F#) G  (A) Bm
O praise Him, O         praise Him,
Bm  E  A   Bm  E  A   G   A  D
Alleluia!  Alleluia!  Alleluia!


Thou rushing wind that art so strong,
Ye clouds that sail in heav'n along,
Alleluia!  Alleluia!
Thou rising morn, in praise rejoice,
Ye lights of evening, find a voice!
O praise Him, O praise Him,
Alleluia!  Alleluia!  Alleluia!


Thou flowing water, pure and clear,
Make music for thy Lord to hear,
Alleluia!  Alleluia!
Thou fire so masterful and bright,
That givest man both warmth and light,
O praise Him, O praise Him,
Alleluia!  Alleluia!  Alleluia!


And all ye men of tender heart,
Forgiving others, take your part,
Alleluia!  Alleluia!
Ye who long pain and sorrow bear,
Praise God, and on Him cast your care,
O praise Him, O praise Him,
Alleluia!  Alleluia!  Alleluia!


Let all things their Creator bless,
And worship Him in humbleness.
Alleluia!  Alleluia!
Praise, praise the Father, praise the Son,
And praise the Spirit, three in one,
O praise Him, O praise Him,
Alleluia!  Alleluia!  Alleluia!
