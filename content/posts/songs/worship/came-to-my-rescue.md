[Intro]
C  G  Am  F  C  G/B  Am  F

[Verse 1]
C                  G
Falling on my knees in worship
Am             F                 C
Giving all I am to seek Your face

Lord all I am is is Yours

C                    G
My whole life I place in Your hands
Am             F               C
God of mercy Humbled I bow down
          G                    Am
In your presence at Your throne


[Chorus]
F   C          G/B   Am
I called You answered
         F                      C

I wanna be where You are

Am                G/B    C
In my life be lifted high

In our world be lifted high
               G          F  G  (F)
In our love be lifted high
