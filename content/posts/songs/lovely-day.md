  E         C#m7      Amaj7         Cmaj7 Bm7
| / / / / | / / / / | / / / / | /  /  /  /  |
  E         C#m7      Amaj7     Cmaj7    Bm7

[Verse 1]
E                     C#m7               Amaj7
When I wake up in the morning love
Amaj7                         Cmaj7 Bm7
And the sunlight hurts my eyes
E                     C#m7             Amaj7
And something without warning love
Amaj7             Cmaj7
Bears heavy on my mind

[Pre-chorus]
C/D                D/E
Then I look at you
                 Am7               Bm7
And the world's alright with me
C/D                  D/E
Just one look at you
                Am7       Bm7
And I know it's gonna be

[Chorus]
         E                          C#m7                  Amaj7                 Cmaj7             Bm7
A lovely day (Lovely day lovely day lovely day lovely day lovely day lovely day lovely day lovely day)
         E                          C#m7                  Amaj7                 Cmaj7             Bm7
A lovely day (Lovely day lovely day lovely day lovely day lovely day lovely day lovely day lovely day)

[Verse 2]
E                      C#m7               Amaj7
When the day that lies ahead of me
Amaj7                     Cmaj7  Bm7
Seems impossible to face
E                   C#m7              Amaj7
When someone else instead of me
Amaj7                    Cmaj7
Always seems to know the way

[Pre-chorus]
C/D                D/E
Then I look at you
                 Am7              Bm7
And the world's alright with me
C/D                  D/E
Just one look at you
                Am7       Bm7
And I know it's gonna be

[Chorus]
         E                          C#m7                  Amaj7                 Cmaj7             Bm7
A lovely day (Lovely day lovely day lovely day lovely day lovely day lovely day lovely day lovely day)
         E                          C#m7                  Amaj7                 Cmaj7             Bm7
A lovely day (Lovely day lovely day lovely day lovely day lovely day lovely day lovely day lovely day)

[Verse 3]
E                       C#m7               Amaj7

Amaj7                    Cmaj7   Bm7
Seems impossible to face
E                   C#m7              Amaj7

Then I look at you
                       Am7               Bm7
And the whole world's alright with me
C/D                  D/E
Just one look at you
                Am7       Bm7
And I know it's gonna be

[Chorus]
         E                          C#m7                  Amaj7                 Cmaj7             Bm7
