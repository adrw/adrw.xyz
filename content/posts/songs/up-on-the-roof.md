Up on the roof
Carole king (attributed to james taylor...)

Rodney Henson Chord Version

      D                   Bm           F#m7
When this old world starts a getting me down
    Em7                 A7sus4        D
And people are just too much for me to face
     D                  Bm          F#m7
I'll climb way up to the top of the stairs
    Em7               A7sus4           D
And all my cares just drift right into space

G            A7   G/B      A7     Em7
On the roof, it's peaceful as can be
    D               Bm    F#m7        Em7     A7sus4
And there the world below don't bother me, no, no

      D                   Bm         F#m7
So when I come home feeling tired and beat
    Em7                 A7sus4        D
I'll go up where the air is fresh and sweet
     D                  Bm          F#m7
I'll get far away from the hustling crowd
    Em7               A7sus4           D
And all the rat-race noise down in the street

G            A7   G/B      A7     Em7
On the roof, that's the only place I know
    D               Bm    F#m7        Em7
Where you just have to wish to make it so
      Asus4        D
Let's go up on the roof

Instrumental:
D  A/D  D  F#m7  Bm   A/B   Bm   Em7  D/F#  G/F#
A/G  A  D/A  D  A/D  D  Em7  A  D


   G            A7   G/B                    Em7
And at night the stars they put on a show for free
     D       A/D      Bm       F#m7    Em7
And, darling, you can share it all with me
              A7sus4
That's what I said.     Keep on telling you that
D                      Bm        F#m7
Right smack dab in the middle of town,
  Em7     D/F G A7sus4           D
I found a paradise that's trouble proof
    D                          Bm          F#m7
And if this old world starts a getting you down
       Em7              A7sus4
There's room enough for two
          D
Up on the roof.
Bm       Em7
Up on the roof
A6       D
Up on the roof
