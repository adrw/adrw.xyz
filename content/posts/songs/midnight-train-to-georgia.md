```
This is probably the most thorough chord tab i've done to date. There's a couple
things to keep in mind:
1) Words not in parenthesis (/) are sung by Gladys
2) Words in parenthesis () are sung by the Pips
3) Words in brackets [] are sung by both'
4) There is a capo on the first fret
5) For those who want to know the actual chord names:

C = C# or Db
Em7 = Fm7
F = F# or Gb
G = G# or Ab
D = D# or Eb
Am = A#m or Bbm

Capo 1.

one way ticket back       To the life   he once knew,
