So I was looking for a tab for this song and surprisingly most of them were
pretty bad. Even the one that was "Unregistered" was close, but still not
the way how Jim Croce played it. So after studying old Jim Croce
performances, I got it down perfect. The only thing that people may still
have trouble with this song is the beat and the hammer-ons and pull-offs
while using the barre chords. But if you either listen to the song or
watch Jim Croce perform it on youtube, then it should be childs play. So
after you have made your final judgement on this tab, please rate and/or
leave a comment.

[Intro]

G D7


[Verse 1]

               G
Well, the south side of Chicago
         A7
Is the baddest part of town.
           B7
And if you go down there
           C                D7 *        C        G  D7
You better just beware of a man name of Leroy Brown.
     G
Now, Leroy more than trouble,
           A7
You see he stand about 'bout six foot four.
                 B7                        C
All the downtown ladies call him "treetop lover."
        D7 *     C            G  D7
All the men just call him "sir."


[Chorus]

         G
And he's bad, bad, Leroy Brown,
    A7
The baddest man in the whole damn town.
B7                      C
Badder than old King Kong
    D7 *          C          G  D7
And meaner than a junkyard dog.


[Verse 2]

     G
Now, Leroy, he a gambler,
       A7
and he like his fancy clothes.
       B7           C
And he like to wave diamond rings
            D7 * C      G  D7
in front of everybody's nose
         G
He got a custom Continental.
          A7
He got an Eldorado too.
         B7                    C
He got a thirty-two gun in his pocket for fun.
         D7 *  C      G    D7
He got a razor in his shoe.


[Chorus]

         G
And he's bad, bad, Leroy Brown,
    A7
The baddest man in the whole damn town.
B7                      C
Badder than old King Kong
    D7 *          C          G  D7
And meaner than a junkyard dog.


[Verse 3]

      G
Well, Friday 'bout a week ago,
A7
Leroy's shootin' dice.
           B7                    C
And at the edge of the bar sat a girl name of Doris
    D7 *     C         G   D7
and oh, that girl look nice
         G
Well, he cast his eyes upon her
        A7
and the trouble soon began.
    B7                        C
And Leroy Brown, he learned a lesson 'bout messin'
         D7 *      C       G   D7
with the wife of a jealous man


[Chorus]

         G
And he's bad, bad, Leroy Brown,
    A7
The baddest man in the whole damn town.
B7                      C
Badder than old King Kong
    D7 *          C          G  D7
And meaner than a junkyard dog.


[Verse 4]

          G
Well, the two men took to fightin'
              A7
And when they pulled them from the floor,
B7                  C                    D7 *      C      G    D7
Leroy looked like a jigsaw puzzle with a couple of pieces gone.


[Chorus] (x2)

         G
And he's bad, bad, Leroy Brown,
    A7
The baddest man in the whole damn town.
B7                      C
Badder than old King Kong
    D7 *          C          G  D7
And meaner than a junkyard dog.

(At the end of the second chorus, don't play the D7. Just take the G chord
 into the outro.)


[Outro]

              B7                   C
Yes, you were badder than old King Kong
    D7 *          C        G
And meaner than a junkyard dog.

End on G
