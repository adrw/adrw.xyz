F  D# F

   F                      G#
My child arrived just the other day
   A#                       F
He came to the world in the usual way
                                   G#
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay
   A#                      F
He learned to walk while I was away
           D#              A#           Cm    A#
And he was talkin' 'fore I knew it, and as he grew
              G#    Cm      F
He'd say "I'm gonna be like you dad
    G#             Cm      F
You know I'm gonna be like you"

        F                           D#
And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
G#                      A#
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
F
When you comin' home dad?
  D#                   G#          Cm     F
I don't know when, but we'll get together then son
    G#                Cm        F
You know we'll have a good time then

F  D# F

   F                       G#
My son turned ten just the other day
          A#                        F
He said, "Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on let's play
                                    G#
Can you teach me to throw", I said "Not today
  A#                          F
I got a lot to do", he said, "That's ok"
       D#      A#          Cm          A#
And he walked away but his smile never dimmed
               G#    Cm      F
And said, "I'm gonna be like him, yeah
    G#             Cm      F
You know I'm gonna be like him"

        F                           D#
And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
G#                      A#
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
F
When you comin' home dad?
  D#                   G#          Cm     F
I don't know when, but we'll get together then son
    G#                Cm        F
You know we'll have a good time then

F  D# F

         F                               G#
Well, he came home from college just the other day
A#                        F
So much like a man I just had to say
                                G#
"Son, I'm proud of you, can you sit for a while?"
   A#                 F
He shook his head and said with a smile
          D#           A#         Cm             A#
"What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys
G#                   F
See you later, can I have them please?"

        F                           D#
And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
G#                      A#
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
F
When you comin' home son?
  D#                   G#          Cm     F
I don't know when, but we'll get together then
    G#                Cm        F
You know we'll have a good time then

C# D# Cm F  2x

     F                      G#
I've long since retired, my son's moved away
  A#                     F
I called him up just the other day
                                G#
I said, "I'd like to see you if you don't mind"
              A#                     F
He said, "I'd love to, Dad, if I can find the time
           D#          A#         Cm            A#
You see my new job's a hassle and kids have the flu
         G#        Cm         F
But it's sure nice talking to you, Dad
          G#        Cm         F
It's been sure nice talking to you"

    D#               A#         Cm        A#
And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
     G#       Cm        F
He'd grown up just like me
   G#      Cm        F
My boy was just like me

        F                           D#
And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
G#                      A#
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
F
When you comin' home son?
  D#                   G#          Cm     F
