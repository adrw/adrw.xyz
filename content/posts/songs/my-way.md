[Verse I]

    C               Em
And now, the end is near,
         Gm             A7
And so I face, the final curtain.
   Dm
My friend, I'll say it clear,
              G7                 C
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain.


[Verse II]

C                         C7
I've lived, a life that's full,
              F               Fm
I've traveled each, and every highway.
    C                    G7
But more, much more than this,
         F  C
I did it my way.


[Verse III]

C                   Em
Regrets, I've had a few,
         Gm                   A7
But then again, too few to mention.
  Dm
I did, what I had to do,
           G7               C
And saw it through, without exemption.


[Verse IV]

C                         C7
I planned, each chartered course,
             F               Fm
Each careful step, along the byway.
    C                    G7
But more, much more than this,
         F  C
I did it my way.


[Verse V]

C                                   C7
Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew,
           F
When I bit off, more than I could chew.
               Dm                  G7
But through it all, when there was doubt,
         Em7             Am
I ate it up, and spit it out.
           Dm               G7
I faced it all, and I stood tall,
           F  C
And did it my way.


[Verse VI]

C                            Em
I've loved, I've laughed and cried,
            Gm                  A7
I've had my fill, my share of losing.
    Dm
And now, as tears subside,
          G7      C
I find it all so amusing.


[Verse VII]

C                   C7
To think, I did all that,
          F             Fm
And may I say, not in a shy way.
   C          G7
Oh no, no not me,
         F  C
I did it my way.


[Verse VIII]

C                              C7
For what is a man, what has he got,
          F
If not himself, then he has naught.
           Dm               G7
To say the things, he truly feels,
           Em7               Am
And not the words, of one who kneels.
           Dm                G7
The record shows, I took the blows,
           F  C
And did it my way.
