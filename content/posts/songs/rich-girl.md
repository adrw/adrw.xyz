[Chorus]

         F                    Am7
You're a rich girl and you've gone too far
            Dm7                     F/C
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
Bb                  F/A
You can rely on the old man's money
Gm7                   Bb/C
You can rely on the old man's money

         F                 Am7
It's a bitch girl but it's gone too far
            Dm7                     F/C
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
Bb                  F/A
  Say money but it won't get you too far,
Gm7              |                                                                    |
Get you too far  | just keep picking the 3rd fret on the D string for 2 measures here |
                 |                                                                    |


[Verse 1]

    Gm7   Am7  Bbmaj7            Gm7            | The Bbmaj7 can be played in a few different ways.
And don't you  know,   don't you know           | I showed you up top.  If that way is too hard,
          F/C      Gm7            Am7   Dm7     | try xx3335 or 6877xx.  You might even be able to
That it's wrong to take what he's givin' you    | get away with playing a Dm7 there instead but H&O
Gm7  Am7  Bbmaj7              Gm7               | play a Bbmaj7
So   far  gone,    on your own
         Gm7             Dm7
You can get along if you try to be strong
           Gm7        Bb/C
But you'll never be strong

High  and  dry,    out of the rain
         F/C         Gm7             Am7        Dm7
It's so easy to hurt others when you can't feel pain
     Gm7  Am7  Bbmaj7            Gm7
And don't you  know    that a love can't grow
                Gm7                            Dm7
'Cause there's too much to give, 'cause you'd rather live
           Gm7              Bb/C
For the thrill of it all        oh
