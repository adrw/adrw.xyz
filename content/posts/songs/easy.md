[Verse 1]

 G#             Cm
Know it sounds funny
                  A#m         A#m7
But I just can't stand the pain
G#        Cm            A#m   A#m7
Girl I'm leaving you tomorrow
G#           Cm
Seems to me girl
                        A#m  A#m7
You know I've done all I can
G#                  Cm
You see I begged, stole
             A#m   D#
And I borrowed


[Chorus]

                    G#   Cm  A#m A#m7
Ooh, that's why I'm easy
                     G#     Cm  A#m A#m7
I'm easy like Sunday morning
               G#   Cm  A#m A#m7
That's why I'm easy
                     F#   C#   G#
I'm easy like Sunday morning


[Verse 2]

 G#             Cm
Why in the world
                  A#m         A#m7
Would anyboddy put chains on me?
G#        Cm            A#m   A#m7
I've paid my dues to make it
G#           Cm
Everbody wants me to be
                        A#m  A#m7
What they want me to be
G#                  Cm
I'm not happy when I try to fake it.  No


[Chorus]

                    G#   Cm  A#m A#m7
Ooh, that's why I'm easy
                     G#     Cm  A#m A#m7
I'm easy like Sunday morning
               G#   Cm  A#m A#m7
That's why I'm easy
                     F#   C#   G#
I'm easy like Sunday morning


[Bridge]

          A#m       F#
I wanna be high, so high
            A#m
I wanna be free to know
                     F#
The things I do are right
           A#m
I wanna be free
     F#      B  F#  C#
Just me, babe!

A#m7           G#   Cm  A#m A#m7
That's why I'm easy
                      G#   Cm  A#m A#m7
I'm easy like Sunday morning
               G#   Cm  A#m A#m7
That's why I'm easy
                      G#   Cm  A#m A#m7
I'm easy like Sunday morning

Because I'm easy

Easy like Sunday morning

Because I'm easy

Easy like Sunday morning
