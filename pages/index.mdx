Tune in for thoughts on frameworks, functions, finance, family, & faith.

I code to solve problems with a founder's **hustle** & a designer's **attention to detail**.

I'm a software engineer on the Cash Platform team at Square building [Misk][misk] and [Misk-Web][misk] scalable frameworks for the [Cash App][cash].

I studied Computer Science at University of Waterloo.
