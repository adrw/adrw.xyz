I code to solve problems with a founder's **hustle** & a designer's **attention to detail**.

I'm a software engineer on the Cash Platform team at Square building [Misk](http://gs.adrw.ch/misk) and [Misk-Web](http://gs.adrw.ch/misk) scalable frameworks for the [Cash App](https://cash.app/).

I studied Computer Science at University of Waterloo.
