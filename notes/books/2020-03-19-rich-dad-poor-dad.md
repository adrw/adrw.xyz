The famous book is often mentioned in real estate investing (landlord) and other personal finance and investing videos. I thought it would be good to read (or listen) to the source material.

Written largely in narrative style retelling stories from childhood learning from his friend's dad ("Rich Dad") and contrasting with his biological, socialist dad ("Poor Dad"), the author presents important personal finance topics in a digestible format.
