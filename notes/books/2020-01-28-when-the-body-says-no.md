A fascinating book by Dr. Gabor Mate (author of Hold on to your Kids) investigating how stress not only has obvious effects on mental health but can also cause physical diseases in the body.

The book cuts directly against the common separation of body and mind that most people, including traditional medical and research communities, hold limiting consideration of stress as a cause for physical diseases including cancer, MS, ALS, and other auto-immune diseases.

With numerous case studies and investigations into key diseases and common stress and mind characteristics of their patients, Mate left a lasting impression on the seriousness that stress can have not only on mental health, but on physical as well.
