Released around the same time as Jeff Bethke's "To Hell with the Hustle", both authors seem to have on their own (or Spirit led) stumbled upon extremely similar revelations on the virtue and neccessity of slowing down and unchoosing the busy modern life.

With many practical tips and lessons from how Comer came to his midlife crisis of business and has entered a new life of freedom and peace through following Jesus' speed and lifestyle including sabbath, silence and solitude, minimalism, non-materialism, and simplicity.

Though with many similar themes to Bethke's book, Comer's writing style and numbered conclusions and lessons have a stronger structure and provide more discrete implementation details for how he has simplified his life by living like Jesus.
