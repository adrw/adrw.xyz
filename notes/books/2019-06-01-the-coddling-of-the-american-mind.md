- Three great untruths have taken over university and leftist culture
  - The untruth of fragility: What doesn't kill you makes you weaker
  - The untruth of emotional reasoning: Always trust your feelings
  - The untruth of us vs them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people
- Each of these accomplish the following
  - It contradicts ancient wisdom
  - It contradicts modern psychological understanding
  - It harms the people that accept these untruths
- Problems include
  - Teen anxiety and suicide rates
  - Ideoological uniformity at universities
  - Political extremists provoking each other to hatred
  - Social media has encouraged a public shaming "call out" culture
  - New social media and news outlets allow retreat into amplified and repeated echo chambers
- Humans are anti-fragile (concept from Nassim Nicholas Taleb of The Black Swan), meaning that like muscles they only grow and succeed when placed under points of stress. Humans psyche, just like their muscles, atrophe when not exercised.
