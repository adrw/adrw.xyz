- System 1: your immediately accessible thinking
- System 2: effortful thinking

- Much human bias comes from assuming our conclusion is from system 2 while really we’ve relied on system 1 since it requires less effort. Humans aren’t made to think probabilistically or statistically. 

- Pupils are the power meter of the mind showing proportional to dilation the amount of mental effort currently being used. 
- Self-control is an effortfull activity and competes with high computation. Trying to do an effort full task that you don’t want to do is that much more difficult because your task now competes for energy with your self-control. 
- “Flow” then is an optimal state where you are so engaged in an effortful task that you don’t require self-control to remain engaged and thus have more energy to use for the primary task.
