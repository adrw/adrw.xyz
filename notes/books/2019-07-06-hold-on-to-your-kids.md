Gabor Mate has been raising the alarm for over a decade. Children are not attaching to their parents like they have done for most of human civilization. Instead, they are attaching to peers, losing the safe acceptance and influence of adults.

His [lecture to parents in 2011](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=p_akH6Cin6E) rings even more true now as kids continue to be raised by their peers, social media, and YouTube and not their parents or other adults.

# Hold on to your Kids Notes

* The spread of peer attachment corresponds in part with the concept of youth culture that is a reasonably new phenomenon of the past 70-80 years. This looks like drastic, rebellious, culturally different generations that no longer turn to their parents to learn the culture passed down.
* 6 Methods of attachment
  * Senses. By smell, sight, sound, or touch, a yearning for physical proximity begins as an infant and continues throughout life.
  * Sameness. Children often attempt to imitate or emulate the people they have attached to, often taking on many similar speech patterns from parents initially, and then peers, for example. Sameness also manifests in attaching through identification, or merging your identity with the person or hero or idea or group you are attached to. 
  * Belonging and Loyalty. Toddlers lay claim to their teddy bear, their mommy, their daddy. Teenagers lay claim to who is whose best friend. Belonging and loyalty follow attraction, thus peer attached kids are loyal to each other, not to parents or ideals.
  * Significance. Feeling we matter and are needed by our special person. Toddlers aim to please and win approval and earn the happy face of who we are attached to. Peer oriented kids call “nice” kids who accept and include them, even if the same kid is mean in other situations.
  * Feeling.
