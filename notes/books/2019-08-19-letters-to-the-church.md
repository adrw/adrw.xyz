Francis Chan's latest book outlines in a series of thematic Revelations-style letters to the modern church, the failings and path forward of a Western church often more concerned with attendance, worship style, and age-denominated ministries, than with raising up disciples who mirror the devotion of the first believers.

> "And they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers." – Acts 2:42 (ESV)

> "And they continued steadfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in prayers." – Acts 2:42 (NKJV)

Deeply thought provoking, I'm excited for what the rest of the book holds. It draws deeply from Chan's learnings founding a megachurch, Cornerstone Community Church, and resigning to start a house church movement, We Are Church.

# We Are Church

Francis Chan after starting and growing Cornerstone Community Church in Simi Valley, California to thousands of congregants from 1994 until 2010, travelled with his family throughout Thailand, China, and Hong Kong. There he saw first hand a model of house church, especially the persecuted one in China, that much more closely reflected what we read in Acts.

Bringing this model back to the US as the Spirit led him, Chan started the We Are Church in San Francisco. Reading through the [Practices](https://www.wearechurch.com/structure-1) section of their website provides a concise outline of how they are bring a radically different model of church to the West.

1. Devotion to Scripture: Everyone reads through the same scripture every week. Scripture is the primary teaching, not a pastor's weekly sermon. The home church pastor instead facilitates discussion during the meeting, encouraging everyone to bring forth what the Spirit was revealing to them through that week's living Word readings.
1. We Meet in Homes: Less capital requirements, easier to multiply and grow, more intimacy.
1. Everyone Discipled and Discipling: Everyone is a disciple or future disciple. Spiritual growth is collective responsibility, not just on the pastor.
1. Everyone Exercises Their Gifts: Not just a few key people preaching and leading worship, everyone is given gifts by the Holy Spirit in order to benefit the church.
 > "To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good." - 1 Corinthians 12:7 (ESV)

    The full passage expands to describe all the gifts of the spirit that can be endowed to people in the church to benefit the church.

    > "There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. There are differences of ministries, but the same Lord. And there are diversities of activities, but it is the same God who works all in all. But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one for the profit of all: for to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit, to another the word of knowledge through the same Spirit, to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healings by the same Spirit, to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another different kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually as He wills." - 1 Corinthians 12:6-11 (NKJV)

1. Regular Multiplication of Churches: Split the group when numbers grow beyond 20-40 people. Preserve intimacy, accountability, and engagement that is only possible in smaller numbers. 
1. Simple Gatherings: Rely on Jesus, not someone's amazing teaching or worship band

# Letters to the Church Notes

## 1 The Departure

* Imagine yourself on an island with just a Bible. How would a church function based only on what you can read, not your knowledge of what church in the West is today? Is it different than your current church experience? Can you live with that?

### Some Background /  Why I Left My Megachurch

Francis built the megachurch, Cornerstone Church in Simi Valley, California, in 1994 from his living room to thousands of people and then left in 2007. Many have asked, why?

In 1994, Francis was 26 years old and had previously been attending a church where there was a lot of infighting and division. That could not be pleasing to God. Francis had been married to Lisa for less than a month when he opened up to her about starting a church out of their house.

Their new church's priorities would be
* Sing directly to God, really sing! Sing with reverence and emotion. Sing as though God is really listening to our voices.
* Hear the Word of God. No self-help nonsense. No ignoring half the Bible. Dig deep into scripture, even the parts that make us uncomfortable, and take it seriously. Truly hear everything the Word of God was saying to us.
* Live holy lives. Too many churches are packed with Christians with no interest in doing what the Bible says.
  > "These people would come back week after week to hear from a Book that demands that they “be doers of the word, and not hearers only” (James 1:22), but they never seemed to do anything." (8)

God worked, things took off! The church grew to thousands flocking to join in the passionate worship and hear the Word of God. They moved from building to bigger building. The podcast gained in popularity. The congregation would cheer and donate generously to foreign missions. Families began adoption children out of the foster care system. But something was missing.

The elders landed on the question: was this definition of success adequate? Is this what God originally imagined church to be?

A key question was the level of love for one another.

  > "Jesus said the world should know us by our love (John 13:35), [but] when unbelievers came to our services, they weren’t observing anything supernatural about the way we loved one another." (10)

Another issue was the increasing reliance on a single person: Francis Chan. What would happen if he left? Could the church sustain membership to support their large buildings and staff, a huge waste of money if false? People should come to church to experience almighty God and the moving of the Holy Spirit, not to hear Francis Chan.

Bible talks about every member of the body having a gift necessary for the functioning of the church. Few people in the crowd every service could use their gifts in that setting. Only a few in leadership or on stage would be, a huge waste of the Spiritual gifts given to all believers.

The church elders repented for how they had neglected Biblical commands and tried to change the direction of Cornerstone but with much difficulty.

### Changing the Rules

One young person felt as if the rules had been changed under him. It was as if at first he was taught that salvation was a free gift from belief in Christ, like receiving a pair of ice skates and now being free to learn and do tricks on the local rink, and now being told that the skates were actually given to him because he was supposed to be part of a hockey team, not just to twirl around by himself.

Francis admits he did not lead the congregation through this attempted transition very well. He had been losing peace and humility as his popularity as speaker and author grew. 

As he began to debate internally the thought of leaving Cornerstone, a chance conversation on the way to an event with Lisa confirmed that she too thought they had done what they could in Simi Valley and it was time to move on. 15 minutes after that, a member at Cornerstone called him to say that God told him to tell Francis "Just go. Don't worry about the church. There are others here who will step up and take care of the church."

And so things fell into place, they sold the house, and moved their family of 6 overseas for a time traveling through India, Thailand, and China. It knit the family together with a focus on mission and opened their eyes to the fearless dedication and boldness of pastors in India, how humble men and women faithfully served widows and orphans in rural Thailand, and the gospel spreading as wildfire despite persecution through the house churches in China.

After a time overseas, Francis felt that the Lord was speaking to him one day to go back to the United States. He emphasizes that his background is extremely conservative, and he doesn't say that he heard from God lightly, leaning and comparing always with what he sees written in the Bible. 

While overseas, Francis had seen a glimpse of what the power of the church could be. God now wanted him to take that vision back. Francis felt daunted by a mission that he felt his intelligence and leadership skills were inadequate to accomplish.

  > "It was a sad day when I told Lisa and the kids that I felt God wanted me back in the States. We were so happy overseas. We were closer as a family, more dependent on God, and more fixated on eternal matters. While there were feelings of fear when we left the United States, now there was greater fear in returning. We didn’t want to lose our focus." (12)

### The Journey Home

Without much planning, they landed in San Francisco primarily because Francis' brother had an open one-bedroom apartment that the family of 6 could live in. He didn't have a big plan, but wanted to live as biblically as he knew how.

> "I told the Lord I wanted to live like Christ, and it seemed like Jesus knew exactly whom to call as His disciples. I asked for that same grace: that I would be able to just walk around the city sharing the gospel, eventually meeting the people He would call me to disciple." (12)

He started a ministry serving the poor in the Tenderloin district, feeding the homeless, going door to door to pray for people in low-income housing. It was uncomfortable, but felt right. God was answering prayer in powerful ways, though there weren't many true conversions.

Asking his oldest daughter what this life now felt like, she blurted "It felt like we jumped out of the Bible." Finally in America, Francis was experiencing something congruent with what we read about in the New Testament! Alive, on an adventure that required faith, in our own backyard.

Daily outreaches were going well but the ministry had weakness from a lack of an elder-led church. Francis, like in the beginning, a few new friends into their home and starting We Are Church, asking God to build His church through them.

In the 5 years since planting, We are Church, Francis and Lisa have grown in their scriptural understanding and entered one of the happiest and most peaceful seasons of life. Not because life is easy, "but a peace from knowing God more deeply than ever" (15). 

> "While I believe I have loved Jesus for years, it feels totally different now. Lately I have become obsessed with knowing and experiencing Him. [Strangely], my intimacy with God has been directly tied to my connection with the Church. This is really weird for me because for years, I felt closest to God when I was away from people and alone in my prayer room. [Now], I actually feel closer to God while praying alongside my church family! It’s as if I can sense His actual presence in the room with us. [...] Just the other day, a one-hour teaching session spontaneously turned into thirteen hours of prayer! We were enjoying His presence together so much that no one wanted to leave!" (15)

### Big Problems

While traveling and speaking, Francis often hears people complaining about their churches, many who have left altogether. The church has real issues, but this is a serious problem! The church is Christ's bride, whom we must love, not gripe or leave.

Some who've abandoned are rebellious and arrogant, others are confused. They love Jesus but struggle to see how their church connects to what they read in scripture. Francis doesn't condone their actions, but instead writes the book as encouragement to return.  

> "The Scriptures tell me you are indispensable and the body cannot function perfectly without you." (15)

Staying mindful of 1 Thessalonians 5:14,

> "Now we exhort you, brethren, warn those who are unruly, comfort the fainthearted, uphold the weak, be patient with all." 1 Thessalonians 5:14 (NKJV)

...Francis admits that a book with this content makes it hard to not leave some feeling like they've been kicked, and others like they've been kicked to action.

> "To the lovers of Jesus who are feeling discouraged, I pray this book gives you hope for what is possible. To those who knowingly or subconsciously are harming the Church, I pray God gives you the grace to repent." (15)

The book is a collection of letters. Each letter addresses a different issue your church may or may not need to work on. Pray that the Holy Spirit would help discern which you and your church must take to heart.

The letters are not addressing obscure details from Leviticus, but the most obvious commands present throughout scripture. Francis writes not from a motiviation of conforming the church to his personal preferences, but to point out the most obvious truths of God's desire for his Bride.

> "There are times when God hates our worship. There are churches He wants shut down. So often we assume that as long as we show up to worship, God is pleased. The Bible tells a different story (Amos 5:21–24; Isa. 58:1–5; Mal. 1:6–14; 1 Cor. 11:17–30; Rev. 2:5; 3:15–16).

Francis can't help but think that God is displeased with many churches in America.

He doesn't say that lightly and encourages readers to have a Bible at their side, to look up whether Francis is twisting the Scriptures or stating the obvious.

### A Humble Warning

Francis writes with a spirit of unity, not that these words would be taken to confront church leadership with arrogance and division. 

Now is a difficult time to be a church leader. Everyone has a voice, few are followers, strong opinions applauded, humility is not. Have grace. "Imagine how difficult it would be to coach a team where each player refuses to follow because he or she has a better plan than the coach" (15).

Remember young David when he refused to harm Saul (1 Samuel 24 and 26). Few have this attitude today, of a holy fear of harming those God had placed in authority.

> "I’m not arguing in favor of abusive leaders, nor am I saying that every leader has God’s blessing. All I’m asking is that we show some humility and respect, even to those who don’t deserve it. Let’s be people of grace." (18)

### Just Open the Door

Remember Revelation 3:19-21.

> "Those whom I love, I reprove and discipline, so be zealous and repent. Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he with me. The one who conquers, I will grant him to sit with me on my throne, as I also conquered and sat down with my Father on his throne." Revelation 3:19-21 (ESV)

> "As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten. Therefore be zealous and repent. Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with him, and he with Me. To him who overcomes I will grant to sit with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat down with My Father on His throne." Revelation 3:19-21 (NKJV)

Jesus doesn't place a insurmountable burden on us, but invites us to join in what He is doing.

### The Clock is Ticking

Often when speaking, Francis has a clock at the back of the room counting down the length of his talk. Sometimes, he pretends that he will die when the clock counts down, and face God.

"This gives me courage to say everything I think He would want me to say. If I really was going to die, I would care very little about people’s complaints. I would be obsessed with seeing the face of God and wanting His approval." (18)

Francis has written this book with the same spirit, trying to write what God has given him to write without fear of the backlash.

# 2 Sacred

Consider the following situations where it seems Scripture documents a punishment too severe for the crime:

* 2 Samuel 6: God killed Uzzah because he touched the ark of the coveneant (which God had forbid anyone from touching) trying to keep it from falling on the ground.
* 1 Samuel 13: King Saul waited seven days for the priest, Samuel, to come and make an offering. When Samuel didn't show up, Saul took it upon himself to make the sacrifice, as a result God took the Kingdom from him.
* Numbers 20: Moses didn't get to see the Promised Land because he struck a rock, instead of speaking to it.
* Acts 5: Ananias and Sapphira were struck dead after selling their land, claiming to donate all proceeds to the church, but secretly keeping some for themselves.

We don't understand "sacred" anymore. Too quickly we say "That isn't fair" believing that certain rights are deserved as humans, yet giving little thought to the rights God deserves as God.

> "His ark of the covenant, His command to Moses, His offerings in the temple, His Holy Spirit, His Holy Communion, His sacred Church. In all the above situations, people rushed into something sacred and paid the price. We shouldn’t be surprised; we should be humbled. We have all done things more irreverent than those mentioned above. Let’s thank God for His mercy and tread more carefully into sacred matters." (20)

### Rushing into the Sacred

In the modern era, we carelessly rush, not wanting to miss out or be unproductive.

While others are quick to judge God's actions and question His commands, we are to be careful even to speak His "hallowed" name (Matthew 6:9, Luke 11:2).

While others pray quickly through opinions and demands, we are to approach His throne with reverance, like a priest entering the Holy of Holies (Ecclesiastes 5:1-3).

Remember that those who talk a lot sin a lot (James 1:19, Proverbs 10:19).
