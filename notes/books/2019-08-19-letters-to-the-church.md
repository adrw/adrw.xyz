Francis Chan's latest book outlines in a series of thematic Revelations-style letters to the modern church, the failings and path forward of a Western church often more concerned with attendance, worship style, and age-denominated ministries, than with raising up disciples who mirror the devotion of the first believers.

> "And they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers." – Acts 2:42 (ESV)

> "And they continued steadfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in prayers." – Acts 2:42 (NKJV)

Deeply thought provoking, I'm excited for what the rest of the book holds. It draws deeply from Chan's learnings founding a megachurch, Cornerstone Community Church, and resigning to start a house church movement, We Are Church.

# We Are Church

Francis Chan after starting and growing Cornerstone Community Church in Simi Valley, California to thousands of congregants from 1994 until 2010, travelled with his family throughout Thailand, China, and Hong Kong. There he saw first hand a model of house church, especially the persecuted one in China, that much more closely reflected what we read in Acts.

Bringing this model back to the US as the Spirit led him, Chan started the We Are Church in San Francisco. Reading through the [Practices](https://www.wearechurch.com/structure-1) section of their website provides a concise outline of how they are bring a radically different model of church to the West.

1. Devotion to Scripture: Everyone reads through the same scripture every week. Scripture is the primary teaching, not a pastor's weekly sermon. The home church pastor instead facilitates discussion during the meeting, encouraging everyone to bring forth what the Spirit was revealing to them through that week's living Word readings.
1. We Meet in Homes: Less capital requirements, easier to multiply and grow, more intimacy.
1. Everyone Discipled and Discipling: Everyone is a disciple or future disciple. Spiritual growth is collective responsibility, not just on the pastor.
1. Everyone Exercises Their Gifts: Not just a few key people preaching and leading worship, everyone is given gifts by the Holy Spirit in order to benefit the church.
 > "To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good." - 1 Corinthians 12:7 (ESV)

    The full passage expands to describe all the gifts of the spirit that can be endowed to people in the church to benefit the church.

    > "There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. There are differences of ministries, but the same Lord. And there are diversities of activities, but it is the same God who works all in all. But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one for the profit of all: for to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit, to another the word of knowledge through the same Spirit, to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healings by the same Spirit, to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another different kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually as He wills." - 1 Corinthians 12:6-11 (NKJV)

1. Regular Multiplication of Churches: Split the group when numbers grow beyond 20-40 people. Preserve intimacy, accountability, and engagement that is only possible in smaller numbers. 
1. Simple Gatherings: Rely on Jesus, not someone's amazing teaching or worship band

# Letters to the Church Notes

## 1 The Departure

* Imagine yourself on an island with just a Bible. How would a church function based only on what you can read, not your knowledge of what church in the West is today? Is it different than your current church experience? Can you live with that?

### Some Background /  Why I Left My Megachurch

Francis built the megachurch, Cornerstone Church in Simi Valley, California, in 1994 from his living room to thousands of people and then left in 2007. Many have asked, why?

In 1994, Francis was 26 years old and had previously been attending a church where there was a lot of infighting and division. That could not be pleasing to God. Francis had been married to Lisa for less than a month when he opened up to her about starting a church out of their house.

Their new church's priorities would be
* Sing directly to God, really sing! Sing with reverence and emotion. Sing as though God is really listening to our voices.
* Hear the Word of God. No self-help nonsense. No ignoring half the Bible. Dig deep into scripture, even the parts that make us uncomfortable, and take it seriously. Truly hear everything the Word of God was saying to us.
* Live holy lives. Too many churches are packed with Christians with no interest in doing what the Bible says.
  > "These people would come back week after week to hear from a Book that demands that they “be doers of the word, and not hearers only” (James 1:22), but they never seemed to do anything." (8)

God worked, things took off! The church grew to thousands flocking to join in the passionate worship and hear the Word of God. They moved from building to bigger building. The podcast gained in popularity. The congregation would cheer and donate generously to foreign missions. Families began adoption children out of the foster care system. But something was missing.

The elders landed on the question: was this definition of success adequate? Is this what God originally imagined church to be?

A key question was the level of love for one another.

  > "Jesus said the world should know us by our love (John 13:35), [but] when unbelievers came to our services, they weren’t observing anything supernatural about the way we loved one another." (10)

Another issue was the increasing reliance on a single person: Francis Chan. What would happen if he left? Could the church sustain membership to support their large buildings and staff, a huge waste of money if false? People should come to church to experience almighty God and the moving of the Holy Spirit, not to hear Francis Chan.

Bible talks about every member of the body having a gift necessary for the functioning of the church. Few people in the crowd every service could use their gifts in that setting. Only a few in leadership or on stage would be, a huge waste of the Spiritual gifts given to all believers.

The church elders repented for how they had neglected Biblical commands and tried to change the direction of Cornerstone but with much difficulty.

### Changing the Rules

One young person felt as if the rules had been changed under him. It was as if at first he was taught that salvation was a free gift from belief in Christ, like receiving a pair of ice skates and now being free to learn and do tricks on the local rink, and now being told that the skates were actually given to him because he was supposed to be part of a hockey team, not just to twirl around by himself.

Francis admits he did not lead the congregation through this attempted transition very well. He had been losing peace and humility as his popularity as speaker and author grew. 

As he began to debate internally the thought of leaving Cornerstone, a chance conversation on the way to an event with Lisa confirmed that she too thought they had done what they could in Simi Valley and it was time to move on. 15 minutes after that, a member at Cornerstone called him to say that God told him to tell Francis "Just go. Don't worry about the church. There are others here who will step up and take care of the church."

And so things fell into place, they sold the house, and moved their family of 6 overseas for a time traveling through India, Thailand, and China. It knit the family together with a focus on mission and opened their eyes to the fearless dedication and boldness of pastors in India, how humble men and women faithfully served widows and orphans in rural Thailand, and the gospel spreading as wildfire despite persecution through the house churches in China.
