Recommended by Jeff Bethke, I found this book to be another great one (I also thoroughly enjoyed his book "Deep Work") from Cal Newport with practical (and researched) practices on how to live a more fulfilling life through minimizing distracting and shallow digital interactions.

One of the mental models I have now taken on is that of differentiating between "connection" and "conversation". Conversation is long form, not text based (phone call, video, or in person), and is much higher bandwidth including the vast majority of human communication that is non-verbal (body language, tone of voice, sarcasm). Additionally, since it is longer form and much higher bandwidth in content that can be covered, an hour of conversation can cover so many more topics and go so much deeper than an hour of texting or messaging back and forth.

Connection on the other hand, are the likes, messages, and other notifications we get from people that give us a false illusion that we have a relationship with them, when really we simply have a few bits of information each interaction instead of someone we have a conversation with where we are exchanging gigabytes or terabytes worth of information. Newport recommends cutting off entirely all connection based interactions (don't like peoples posts, don't text back and forth) with exception for coordinating your next conversation with a person.

I've also found benefit from spending more time away from my phone. For example, I now leave it at my desk when coming downstairs for lunch and charge it at my desk far away from my bed.
