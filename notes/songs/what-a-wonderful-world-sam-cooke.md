[Intro]
G  Em

[Verse 1]
G                      Em
Don't know much about history,
C                   D
Don't know much bi-ology.
G                        Em
Don't know much about a science book,
C                          D
Don't know much about the French I took.

[Chorus 1]
G                   C
But I do know that I love you,
G                       C
And I know that if you love me too;
       D                          G
What a wonderful world this would be.

[Verse 2]
G                         Em
Don't know much about ge-ography,
C                      D
Don't know much trigo-nometry.
G                      Em
Don't know much about algebra,
C                        D
Don't know what a slide rule is for.

[Chorus 2]
G                      C
But I do know one and one is two,
G                      C
And if this one could be with you;
       D                          G
What a wonderful world this would be.

[Bridge 1]
    D                G
Now I don't claim to be an 'A' student,
D                  G
But I'm tryin' to be.
       A7                          G
For maybe by being an 'A' student, baby,
A7                D7
I could win your love for me.

[Verse 3]
G                      Em
Don't know much about history,
C                   D
Don't know much bi-ology.
G                        Em
Don't know much about a science book,
C                          D
Don't know much about the French I took.

[Chorus 3]
G                   C
But I do know that I love you,
G                       C
And I know that if you love me too;
       D                          G
What a wonderful world this would be.

[Verse 4]
       G             Em
La ta, ta ta ta ta... (history),
C           D
Mmm... (bi-ology).
        G                        Em
Woah, la ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta, (science book),
C       D
Mmm... (French I took).

[Chorus 4]
G                   C
But I do know that I love you,
G                       C
And I know that if you love me too;
       D                          G  D  G
What a wonderful world this would be.
