[Verse]

C               G
I don't know if you can see,
    Am                     F
The changes that have come over me.
         C                  G
In these last few days I've been afraid,
       Am          F
That I might drift away.
          C                G
I've been telling stories, singing songs,
     Am                  F
That make me think about where I come from.
C                 G
That's the reason why I seem
   Am       F
So far away today.

[Chorus]
C                      G
Let me tell you that I love you,
       Am                      F
That I think about you all the time.
                 C
Caledonia you're calling me,
        G     C
Now I'm going home.
    C                    G
But if I should become a stranger,
          Am                         F
Know that it would make me more than sad,
                 G                    C
Caledonia's been everything I've ever had.

[Verse]
C                  G
Now I have moved and kept on moving,
Am                  F
Proved the points that I needed proving,
C               G
Lost the friends that I needed losing,
Am              F
Found others on the way.
C                       G
I have kissed the ladies and left them crying,
Am                   F
Stolen dreams, yes there's no denying,
C                               G
I have travelled hard sometimes with conscience flying,
Am              F
Somewhere with the wind.

[Chorus]
C                      G
Let me tell you that I love you,
       Am                      F
That I think about you all the time.
                 C
Caledonia you're calling me,
        G     C
Now I'm going home.
    C                    G
But if I should become a stranger,
          Am                         F
Know that it would make me more than sad,
                 G                    C
Caledonia's been everything I've ever had.

[Verse]
C                      G
Now I'm sitting here before the fire,
Am              F
The empty room, a forest choir,
    C                   G
The flames that couldn't get any higher,
             Am         F
They've withered now they've gone.
   C                     G
But I'm steady thinking my way is clear,
Am                      F
And I know what I will do tomorrow,
C                       G
When hands have shaken, and kisses flown,
Am        F
Then I will disappear.

[Chorus]
C                      G
Let me tell you that I love you,
       Am                      F
That I think about you all the time.
                 C
Caledonia you're calling me,
        G     C
Now I'm going home.
    C                    G
But if I should become a stranger,
          Am                         F
Know that it would make me more than sad,
                 G                    C
Caledonia's been everything I've ever had.
