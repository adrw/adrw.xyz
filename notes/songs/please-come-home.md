[Intro]
G C D C G C Em D 

[Verse 1]
       G         C
Well I woke one morning, 
           D       C
found you staring down at me, 
               G       C          Em     D
you said "I'll take my share now, father please", 
        G         C
and you took your money, 
        D         C
and you took your leave, 
    G          C         Em          D          C (let ring)
you drilled my heart and turned your back on me... 

[Verse 2]
        G       C
And you hit the town, 
        D        C
and you hit the bottle hard, 
G         C             Em    D             G            C
you race 'round in your fancy cars and you blow all your money,
   D         C
on brothels, beds, and bars, 
G          C         Em      D         C
before you know your broken times get hard...

[Chorus]
D                    G
I still stand here waiting, 
         C                 G
with my eyes fixed on the road, 
       D                      G
and I fight back tears and I wonder, 
          C           G   G?
if you're ever coming home, 
          Em               C
don't you know son that I love you, 
       G                      D
and I don't care where you've been, 
                G (go into Pre-Verse)
so please come home. 

[Pre Verse]

[Verse 3]
         G           C
And now you've hit bottom,
           D    C 
all those open doors have shut, 
          G       C          Em     D         
and you're hungry stomach's tied in knots, 
           G           C
but I know what you're thinking, 
         D         C
that you troubled me enough, 
              G     C    Em     D           C
nothing could ever separate you from my love...

[Chorus]
D                      G
I still stand here waiting, 
          C                 G
with my eyes fixed on the road, 
       D                      G
and I fight back tears and I wonder, 
          C           G   G?
if you're ever coming home, 
          Em               C
don't you know son that I love you, 
       G                      D
and I don't care where you've been, 
         Em                  C
yes and i'll be right here waiting, 
          G                D
'til you come around the bend, 
       Em              C
and I run to you and hold you close, 
 G               D
won't let go again,
                C
so please come home, 

[Outro]
            C
please come home... 
 
           Em               C
Don't you know son that I love you? 
       G                         D
And I don't care where you've been, 
               C
so please come home.
