[Intro]

G C/G  G C/G
G C/G  G C/G


[Verse 1]

G             Em      C             D
Why are there so many songs about rainbows,
     G             Em    C    D
and what's on the other side?
G             Em      C          D
Rainbows are visions, but only illusions.
G                   Em    C
Rainbows have nothing to hide.


[Pre-chorus]

Cmaj7
So we've been told and some choose to believe it.
Bm7
I know they're wrong; wait and see.


[Chorus]

Am                D          Bm7        E
Some day we'll find it, the rainbow connection,
Am               D             G
The lovers, the dreamers, and me.


[Interlude]

G C/G  G C/G


[Verse 2]

G             Em              A              D
Who said that every wish will be heard and answered
      G             Em    C     D
when wished on a morning star?
G          Em                  C         D
Somebody thought of that and someone believed him.
G               Em    C
Look what it's done so far.


[Pre-chorus]

Cmaj7
What's so amazing and keeps us stargazing?
Bm7
What do we think we might see?


[Chorus]

Am                D          Bm7        E
Some day we'll find it, the rainbow connection,
Am               D             G
The lovers, the dreamers, and me.


[Bridge]

D/F#        Em         D
All of us under its spell,
C                 G/B       D  Eb
We know that it's probably magic


[Verse 3] (Key Change)

Ab             Fm               Db         Eb
Have you been half asleep and have you heard voices?
Ab               Fm    Db        Eb
I've heard them calling my name.
Ab             Fm                 Db             Eb
Are these the sweet sounds that called the young sailors?
   Ab                 Fm          Db
I think that they're one and the same.


[Pre-chorus]

Dbmaj7
I've heard it too many times to ignore it.
Cm7                                 E
It's something that I'm supposed to be.


[Chorus]

Db             Eb            Cm7     F
Someday we'll find it the rainbow connection,
Db               Eb            Ab
the lovers, the dreamers and me.


[Outro]

Eb/G     Fm        Eb
Da-da-da-dee-dee-da-dum
Db    Eb       Ab
Da-da-da-dee-da
