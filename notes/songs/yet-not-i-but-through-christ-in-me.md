[Verse 1]
G                          G/B   C
What gift of grace is Jesus my redeemer
            G               G/B      D
There is no more for heaven now to give
         G                 G/B      C
He is my joy, my righteousness, and freedom
             G        D                  G
My steadfast love, my deep and boundless peace


[Refrain 1]
          C                G/D    G
To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus
       C                       D
For my life is wholly bound to his
       Em          G/D            G/B            C
Oh how strange and divine, I can sing: all is mine!
        G              D         G
Yet not I, but through Christ in me


[Verse 2]
G                          G/B   C
The night is dark but I am not forsaken
          G           G/B           D
For by my side, the Saviour He will stay
         G              G/B   C
I labour on in weakness and rejoicing
          G         D          G
For in my need, His power is displayed


[Refrain 2]
          C                 G/D    G
To this I hold, my Shepherd will defend me
            C                      D
Through the deepest valley He will lead
       Em            G/D         G/B       C
Oh the night has been won, and I shall overcome!
        G              D         G
Yet not I, but through Christ in me


[Verse 3]
          G               G/B   C
No fate I dread, I know I am forgiven
           G           G/B             D
The future sure, the price it has been paid
         G              G/B   C
For Jesus bled and suffered for my pardon
          G         D          G
And He was raised to overthrow the grave


[Refrain 3]
          C                 G/D    G
To this I hold, my sin has been defeated
            C                      D
Jesus now and ever is my plea
       Em            G/D         G/B       C
Oh the chains are released, I can sing: I am free!
        G              D         G
Yet not I, but through Christ in me


[Verse 4]
           G                G/B    C
With every breath I long to follow Jesus
           G                 G/B      D
For He has said that He will bring me home
           G                  G/B   C
And day by day I know He will renew me
          G         D             G
Until I stand with joy before the throne


[Refrain 4]
          C                 G/D    G
To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus
        C                 D
All the glory evermore to Him
         Em         G/D             G/B        C
When the race is complete, still my lips shall repeat:
        G              D         G
Yet not I, but through Christ in me!


[Outro]
       Em            G/D         G/B       C
When the race is complete, still my lips shall repeat:
        G              D         Em
Yet not I, but through Christ in me!
        G              D         Em
Yet not I, but through Christ in me!
        G              D         G
Yet not I, but through Christ in me!
