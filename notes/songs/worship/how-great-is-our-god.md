[Verse 1]
 G                          Em7
The splendor of the King, clothed in majesty,
                    C2
Let all the earth rejoice, all the earth rejoice.
 G                               Em7
He wraps Himself in light, and darkness tries to hide,
                     C2
And trembles at his voice, trembles at his voice.


[Chorus]
G                     D/F#
How great is our God, sing with me,
Em7                   D/F#
How great is our God, all will see,
C             D             G
How great, how great is our God.


[Verse 2]
 G                        Em7
Age to age He stands, and time is in His hands,
                    C2
Beginning and the end, beginning and the end.
 G                         Em7
The Godhead, three in one: Father, Spirit, Son,
                     C2
The Lion and the Lamb, the Lion and the Lamb.


[Chorus]
G                     D/F#
How great is our God, sing with me,
Em7                   D/F#
How great is our God, all will see,
C             D             G
How great, how great is our God.


[Bridge]
G              D/F#
Name above all names,
Em7             D/F#
Worthy of all praise,
C
My heart will sing
D                G
How great is our God.


[Bridge]
G              D/F#

How great is our God.

How great, how great is our God.

How great is our God, all will see,
C             D             G
How great, how great is our God.
G                     D/F#
How great is our God, sing with me,
Em7                   D/F#
How great is our God, all will see,
C             D             G
How great, how great is our God.

Em7                   D/F#
How great is our God, all will see,
C             D             G
