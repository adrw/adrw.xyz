[Verse 1]
G            D                 Em
You are my strength when I am weak
            G               C
You are the treasure that I seek
           G   D  G   D
You are my all in all

G           D             Em
Seeking You as a precious jewel
             G            C
Lord to give up, I'd be a fool
           G   D  G   D
You are my all in all

[Chorus]
G  D    Em      G    C     G        D
Jesus, Lamb of God, worthy is Your name
G  D    Em      G    C      D       G
Jesus, Lamb of God, worthy is Your name

[Verse 2]
G         D                 Em
Taking my sin, my cross, my shame
       G                   C
Rising again, I bless Your name
           G   D  G   D
You are my all in all

G           D                 Em
When I fall down, You pick me up
          G                C
When I am dry, You fill my cup
           G   D  G   D
You are my all in all
