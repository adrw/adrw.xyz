[Verses]
C#m                 E             B     A
Beholding your beauty is all I long for
C#m                 E             B
To worship You Jesus with my soul's desire
A                  E                       B                        C#m
For this very heart you have shaped for your pleasure
            A               B                    E
For the purpose to lift your name high

C#m                 E        B             A
Hear and surrender in pure adoration
C#m            E                     B             A
I enter your courts with an offering of praise
A              E                   B                  C#m
I am your servant come to bring you glory
A                     B                  E
As is fit for the work of your hands

A
Now Unto the Lamb
         E
Who sits on the throne
       B                                  C#m A
Be glory and honour and praise
A                        E
All of creation resounds with the song
B                                                A
Worship and praise the Lord of Lords

    C#m            E               B               A
The spirit now living and dwelling within me
C#m                E                B
Keep my eyes fixed ever upon Jesus' face
A               E                             B     C#m
Let not the things of this world ever sway me
A               B             E
I'll run 'till I finish the race

             A
Singing unto the Lamb
         E
Who sits on the throne
       B                                  C#m A
Be glory and honour and praise
A                        E                                                 A                   E
All of creation resounds with the song  (2nd time All of eternity echoes the song)
B                                                A
Worship and praise the Lord of Lords
