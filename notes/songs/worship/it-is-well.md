[Verse 1]

  G                     C  D      G
When peace like a river attendeth my way,
      Em          A           D
When sorrows like sea billows roll,
    G        C            A            D
Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say,
       G            C    D   G
"It is well, it is well with my soul."


[Chorus]
       G             D
It is well,  (It is well,)
         D               G
With my soul,  (With my soul,)
       C           G    D       G
It is well, it is well with my soul.


[Verse 2]
        G                             C  D         G
Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come
         Em       A         D
Let this blest assurance control
        G           C        A         D
That Christ has regarded my helpless estate
         G           C      D      G
And has shed His own blood for my soul


[Verse 3]
   G                             C  D      G
My sin - O, the bliss of this glorious thought
   Em            A            D
My sin - not in part but the whole
    G              C          A          D
Is nailed to the cross and I bear it no more
             G               C    D     G
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul


[Verse 4]
      G                             C     D        G
And, Lord haste the day when the faith shall be sight
         Em               A         D
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll
     G            C              A          D
The trump shall resound and the Lord shall descend
     G           C     D      G
Even so - it is well with my soul
