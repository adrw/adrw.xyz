Capo on 4 (Key of B)
Easy Song to get the hang of [:
I use down strum mostly. Accents!! Especially on the parenthesized G's.


[Verse 1]
   G
I hear the Saviour say
       D                 G
Thy strength indeed is small.
(G)                          C
Child of weakness watch and pray
        G         D      G
Find in me thine all in all.


[Chorus]
G             C
Jesus paid it all.
G             D
All to Him I owe.
G                 C
Sin had left a crimson stain,
    G          D      G
He washed it white as snow.


[Verse 2]
      G
Lord now indeed I find
      D               G
Thy power and thine alone
(G)                     C
Can change the lepers spots
     G         D        G
And melt the heart of stone


[Chorus]
G             C
Jesus paid it all.
G             D
All to Him I owe.
G                 C
Sin had left a crimson stain,
    G          D      G
He washed it white as snow.


[Verse 3]
     G
And when before the throne
    D              G
I stand in him complete
 (G)                   C
Jesus died my soul to save
    G           D      G
My lips shall still repeat


[Chorus]
G             C
Jesus paid it all.
G             D
All to Him I owe.
G                 C
Sin had left a crimson stain,
    G          D      G
He washed it white as snow.


[Refrain]
     G                  C
Oh praise the one who paid my debt
     G                   C
And raised this life up from the dead. (x6)


[Chorus]
G             C
Jesus paid it all.
G             D
All to Him I owe.
G                 C
Sin had left a crimson stain,
    G          D      G
He washed it white as snow.
    G          D      G
He washed it white as snow.
    G          D      G
He washed it white as snow.
