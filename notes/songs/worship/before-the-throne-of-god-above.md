Capo 5

[Intro]
 E A2 E

           E         A2    E
Before the throne of God above
                            G#m
I have a strong and perfect plea;
             A2           B      C#m
A great High Priest Whose name is Love,
         F#m                  E
Who ever lives and pleads for me.
           A2     E       B
My name is graven on His hands;
E            A2    B       C#m
My name is written on His heart.
             A2       B          C#m
I know that while in Heav'n He stands,
              A2               C#m
No tongue can bid me thence depart.
              A2                E
No tongue can bid me thence depart.


           E         A2     E
When Satan tempts me to despair
                            G#m
And tells me of the guilt within,
         A2        B       C#m
Upward I look and see Him there,
            F#m             E
Who made an end to all my sin.
          A2       E      B
Because a sinless Savior died,
E         A2        B      C#m
My sinful soul is counted free.
            A2       B    C#m
For God the Just is satisfied
           A2            C#m
To look on Him and pardon me,
           A2             E
To look on Him and pardon me.


            E          A2    E
Behold Him there, the risen Lamb;
                             G#m
My perfect, spotless Righteousness;
               A2   B   C#m
The great, unchangeable I Am;
            F#m            E
The King of Glory and of grace.
           A2       E     B
One in Himself, I cannot die;
E           A2       B       C#m
My soul is purchased by His blood!
           A2        B         C#m
My life is hid with Christ on high,
                A2           C#m
With Christ my Savior and my God,
                A2            E
With Christ my Savior and my God.
