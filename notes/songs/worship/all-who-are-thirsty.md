[Verse 1]
G
All who are thirsty
          Em7
All who are weak
            C2
Come to the fountain
                      Am7   Em7       C
Dip your heart in the stream of   life
                     G
Let the pain and the sorrow
          Em7
Be washed away
                    C2
In the waves of his mercy
              Am7            Em7    D
As deep cries out to deep

We sing


[Chorus 1]
G               C2
Come Lord Jesus come
G               C2
Come Lord Jesus come
G               C2
Come Lord Jesus come


[Chorus 2]
G           C2
Holy Spirit come
G           C2
Holy Spirit come
G           C2
Holy Spirit come
G           C2
Holy Spirit come
