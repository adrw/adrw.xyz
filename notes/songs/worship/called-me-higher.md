[Verse 1]
C
I could just sit, I could just sit and
F
wait for all your goodness, hope to feel Your presence
C
I could just stay, I could just stay right where
F
I am and hope to feel You, hope
                           C    F
to feel something again


C
I could hold on, I could hold on to who
  F
I am and never let You change me from the inside
C
I could be safe, I could be safe here in Your
F
arms and never leave home, never let these walls down


[Chorus]
    Am                          C
But You have called me higher, You have called me deeper
         F
And I'll go where You will lead me, Lord
    Am                          C
But You have called me higher, You have called me deeper
         F
And I'll go where You will lead me, Lord, You'll lead me
C                     F
  You'll lead me Lord
