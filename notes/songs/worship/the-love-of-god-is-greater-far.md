Capo 2

D
The love of God is greater far
               A            D
Than tongue or pen can ever tell
        D
It goes beyond the highest star
            A             D
And reaches to the lowest hell


           G                     D
The guilty pair, bowed down with care
             A      D
God gave His Son to win
           G              D
His erring child, He reconciled
             A        D
And pardoned from his sin


              D
Could we with ink, the ocean fill
             A                   D
And were the skies, of parchment made
           D
Were every stalk on earth a quill
          A                D
And every man, a scribe by trade


             G           D
To write the love of God above
                A     D
Would drain the ocean dry
              G                  D
Nor could the scroll contain the whole
                      A      Bm G   Bm G
Though stretched from sky to sky


     Bm  G       Bm  G       C   Em
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah


           G                 D
Oh love of God, how rich and pure
           A        D
How measureless and strong
            G          Bm
It shall forevermore endure
                A       D
The saints' and angels' song.
