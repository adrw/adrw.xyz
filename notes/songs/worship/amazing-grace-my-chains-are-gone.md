[Intro]
G D G D

[Verse 1]
G                 Cadd9     G
 Amazing grace how sweet the sound
     G                   D
 That saved a wretch like me
  G                  Cadd9   G
 I once was lost, but now I'm found
    G         D     G
 Was blind but now I see


[Verse 2]
      G                    Cadd9    G
 â€™Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
    G               D
 And grace my fears relieved;
    G        G/B      Cadd9  G
 How precious did that grace appear,
    G      D       G       Cadd9 G
 The hour I first believed!


[Chorus]
              Cadd9               G
 My chains are gone, I've been set free.
           Cadd9                G
 My God, My Saviour has ransomed me.
           Cadd9           G/B
 And like a flood his mercy reigns.
          Am7   D       G     D G D
 Un-ending love, amazing grace


[Verse 3]
    G                 Cadd9   G
 The Lord has promised good to me,
    G               D
 His word my hope secures;
   G       G/B        Cadd9   G
 He will my shield and portion be,
           D      G     Cadd9 G
 As long as life endures.


[Chorus]
              Cadd9               G
 My chains are gone, I've been set free.
           Cadd9                G
 My God, My Saviour has ransomed me.
           Cadd9           G/B
 And like a flood his mercy reigns.
          Am7  D        G
 Un-ending love, amazing grace

              Cadd9               G
 My chains are gone, I've been set free.
           Cadd9                G
 My God, My Saviour has ransomed me.
           Cadd9           G/B
 And like a flood his mercy reigns.
          Am7  D        G
 Un-ending love, amazing grace


[Verse 4]
    G                  Cadd9      G
 The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,
    G              D
 The sun forbear to shine;
    G                  Cadd9  G
 But God, who called me here below,
    G      D    G     Cadd9 G
 Will be forever mine.
    G      D    G     Cadd9 G
(Will be forever mine)
    G      D    G
(You are forever mine)
