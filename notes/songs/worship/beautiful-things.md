[Verse]
G  A/G  D
All this pain
                 G     A/G      D
I wonder if Iâ€™ll ever find my way
                 G            A/G    Bm7     D/F#  G  A/G  D
I wonder if I my life could really change  at        all
 G   A/G D
All this earth
                 G     A/G      D
Could all that is lost ever be found
                 G           A/G         Bm7    D/A  G  A/G  D
Could a garden come up from this ground at      all


[Chorus]
D
You make beautiful things
D
You make beautiful things out of the dust
D
You make beautiful things
D
You make beautiful things out of us


[Verse]
G  A/G  D
All around
                   G       A/G      D
Hope is springing up from this old ground
             G       A/G    Bm7  D/F#   G  A/G  D
Out of chaos life is being found in You


[Chorus]
D
You make beautiful things
                                          D+
You make beautiful things out of the dust
G
You make beautiful things

You make beautiful things out of us


[Instrumental]
D  F#m  G  D


[Bridge]
D           F#m          G          D
You make me new, You are making me new
