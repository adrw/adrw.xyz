Capo 3

Em7 C2 G   x2

[Verse 1]
      Em7     C2       G
I can see the promised land
               Em7    C2       G
Though there's pain within the plan
         Em7     C2     G
There is victory in the end
     C2         Em7    D
Your love is my battle cry

[Verse 2]
        Em7        C2     G
When my fears like Jericho
            Em7    C2       G
Build their walls around my soul
        Em7      C2     G
When my heart is overthrown
     C2         Em7    D
Your love is my battle cry
    C2         Em7     D
The anthem for all my life

[Chorus 1]
      G
Every giant will fall
The mountains will move
      C2
Every chain of the past
You've broken in two
      Em7
Over fear, over lies
We're singing the truth
     C2           D
That nothing is impossible
     C2 Em7 D G     C2 Em7 D G
With you       With you

[Verse 3]
         Em7    C2       G
There is hope within the fight
       Em7       C2       G
In the wars that rage inside
           Em7     C2         G
Though the shadows steal the light
     C2         Em7    D
Your love is my battle cry
    C2         Em7     D
The anthem for all my life

[Chorus 2]
 G
Every giant will fall
The mountains will move
      C2
Every chain of the past
You've broken in two
      Em7
Over fear, over lies
We're singing the truth
     C2           D
That nothing is impossible   x2
  C2 Em7 D G                  C2     Em7 D G
With you    Oh, nothing is impossible

[Chorus 2]
      C2
No greater name
     D
No higher name
      Em7
No stronger name
      D
Than Jesus

    C2
You overcame
      D
Broke every chain
   Em7
Forever reign
      D
King Jesus

C2
No greater name
     D
No higher name
      Em7
No stronger name
      D
Than Jesus

Broke every chain
   C2
Forever reign
      D
King Jesus

G
Every giant will fall
The mountains will move
      C2
Every chain of the past
You've broken in two
      Em7
Over fear, over lies
We're singing the truth
     C2           D
That nothing is impossible


G
Every giant will fall
      Am7          G/B
The mountains will move
      C2
Every chain of the past
You've broken in two
      Em7        D7
Over fear, over lies
       G          Am7
We're singing the truth
     C2           D
That nothing is impossible

With you    Oh, nothing is impossible
