Capo 4


[Verse 1]
    Em
Mercy mercy
G/B      C     G
Bring me to my knees
      Em
As the morning
         G/B       C       G
Calls to light the dark in me
        Em
Heaven's story
          G/B    C     G
Breathing life into my bones
     Em
Spirit lift me
          G/B       C       G
From this wasteland lead me home


[Pre-Chorus]
    D
Now I
        C        G
Find my life in Yours
   D
My eyes
       C
On Your Name


[Chorus]
     Em
Arrest my heart
            G
From its reckless path
   C                   Am
Release the chains in me
  Em
Awake my soul
           G
To the hope You hold
        C             Am
Your grace is all I need


[Instrumental]
Em  G/B  C  G


[Verse 2]
     Em
Humble glory
         G/B   C      G
Chose to carry all my shame
      Em
Rendered worthy
       G/B    C       G
In the shadow of Your Name
      Em
Gracious fury
        G/B   C         G
Written in my Saviour's scars
     Em
Mercy mercy
      G/B     C      G
Now engraved upon my heart


[Pre-Chorus]
    D
Now I
        C        G
Find my life in Yours
   D
My eyes
       C
On Your Name


[Chorus] (x2)
     Em
Arrest my heart
            G
From its reckless path
   C                   Am
Release the chains in me
  Em
Awake my soul
           G
To the hope You hold
        C             Am
Your grace is all I need


[Instrumental] (x2)
Em  G/B  C  G


[Outro]
    Em
Mercy mercy
G/B      C     G
Bring me to my knees
      Em
As the morning
         G/B       C       G
Calls to light the dark in me
