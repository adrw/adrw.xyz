[Intro]
F  C  G (3x)
F  C

[Verse 1]
G          F
A thousand times I’ve failed
             C          G
Still Your mercy remains
             F
And should I stumble again
          C          G
I’m caught in Your grace
     Am
Everlasting
       F                   C          G
Your light will shine when all else fades
        Am
Never ending
     F             C        G  F  C  G  F  C
Your glory goes beyond all fame


[Verse 2]
G           F
Your will above all else
      C       G
My purpose remains
           F
The art of losing myself
       C          G
In bringing You praise
     Am
Everlasting
       F                   C          G
Your light will shine when all else fades
      Am
Never ending
     F             C        G
Your glory goes beyond all fame


[Chorus 1]
F                      C
In my heart and my soul
        Am         G
Lord I give You control
    F               C       G
Consume me from the inside out
            F          C
Lord let justice and praise
  Am         G
Become my embrace
    F                C      Dm
To love You from the inside out (repeat)


[Chorus 2]
     Am
Everlasting
       F                   C          G
Your light will shine when all else fades
      Am
Never ending
     F             C        G
Your glory goes beyond all fame
           C           F
And the cry of my heart
           G      Am
Is to bring You praise
          F      G
From the inside out
            F      G
Lord my soul cries out


[Instrumental]
F  C  Am  G  F  Am  G  Dm


[Coda]
F      G        Am
cries out. Everlasting
       F                   C          G
Your light will shine when all else fades
      Am
Never ending
     F             C        G
Your glory goes beyond all fame
           C           F
And the cry of my heart
           G      Am
Is to bring You praise
          F      G
From the inside out
            F      G
Lord my soul cries out
          F      G
From the inside out
             F       G       F    C
Lord, my soul cries out, Lord
