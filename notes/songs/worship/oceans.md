[Intro]
Bm   A/C#    D      A      G


[Verse 1]
Bm              A/C#       D
You call me out upon the waters
           A                    G
The great unknown where feet may fail
Bm                  A/C#     D
And there I find You in the mystery
           A                    G
In oceans deep   My faith will stand


[Chorus]
G           D              A
And I will call upon Your name
G            D             A                  G
And keep my eyes above the waves   When oceans rise
              D              A
My soul will rest in your embrace
           G         (A)     Bm
For I am Yours  and You are mine


[Interlude]
Bm A/C#  D  A  Em/G


[Verse 2]
Bm                     A/C#    D
Your grace abounds in deepest waters
                A                  G
Your sovereign hand   Will be my guide
Bm                      A/C#      D
Where feet may fail and fear surrounds me
               A                       G
You've never failed and you won't start now

[Chorus]
G           D              A
So I will call upon Your name
G            D             A                  G
And keep my eyes above the waves   When oceans rise
              D              A
My soul will rest in your embrace
           G         (A)     Bm
For I am Yours  and You are mine
