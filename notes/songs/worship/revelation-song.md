[Intro]
D   Am   C   G   (x2)


[Verse 1] (x2)
D              Am
  Worthy is the, Lamb who was slain
C                G
  Holy, Holy, is He

  Sing a new song, to him who sits on

  Heaven's mercy seat

  With all creation I sing

  Praise to the King of Kings

D                    Am
 Clothed in rainbows, of living color
C                        G
 Flashes of lightning, rolls of thunder
D                                Am
 Blessing and honor, strength and glory and power be
C                     G
 To You the only wise King

  Holy, Holy, Holy
Am
  Is the Lord God Almighty
C                             G

  With all creation I sing
Am
  Praise to the King of Kings

  You are my everything

  And I will adore You...


[Verse 3]
D                    Am
  Filled with wonder, awestruck wonder
C                         G
  At the mention of your name
D
  Jesus your name is power
Am
  Breath and living water
C                     G
  Such a marvelous mystery...

  Holy, Holy, Holy
Am
  Is the Lord God Almighty
C                             G
  Who was, and is, and is to come
D
  With all creation I sing
Am
  Praise to the King of Kings
C
  You are my everything
      G               D
  And I will adore You...
Am  C                G
    I will adore You
