Capo 2

[Intro]
   G

[Verse 1]
G
Behold the Father’s heart
    C
The mystery He lavishes on us
   Em               G
As deep cries out to deep
                       C
Oh how desperately He wants us
    Em                   G
The things of earth stand next to Him
                     C
Like a candle to the sun
             Em           D         C
Unfailing Father what compares to His Great Love

[Verse 2]
  G
Behold His holy Son
     C
The Lion and the Lamb given to us
    Em           G
The Word became a man
                                C
That my soul should know its Saviour
   Em                          G
Forsaken for the sake of all mankind
                    C
Salvation is in His blood
          Em     D                 C
Jesus Messiah the righteous died for love
            Em       D           C
It wasn’t over for He is the risen One

[Chorus 1]
              G                   Em
Then sings my soul, then sings my soul
               D                      C
How great Your love is, how great Your love is
              G                   Em
Then sings my soul, then sings my soul
               D                      C
How great Your love is, how great Your love is
              G
Then sings my soul

[Verse 3]
  G
Behold I have a friend
        C
The Spirit breathing holy fire within
   Em          G
My ever present help
                            C
Speaking truth when I can’t find it
      Em
Light up this broken heart
             G
And light my way
                          C
Until my time on earth is done
            Em           D              C
Oh Holy Spirit breathe in me like kingdom come
            Em         D            C
Oh Holy Spirit let Your work in me be done

[Chorus 2]
              G                   Em
Then sings my soul, then sings my soul
               D                      C
How great Your love is, how great Your love is
              G                   Em
Then sings my soul, then sings my soul
               D                      C
How great Your love is, how great Your love is
              Em                   G
Then sings my soul, then sings my soul
               D                      C
How great Your love is, how great Your love is
              G
Then sings my soul

[Outro]
   D
My God
       C             G
He who was and is to come
            Em           G                Dsus4 D
Prepare the way until the work on earth is done
             C                     Dsus4
Watch as the clouds He rides swing low
            Em                              C
Lift up the sound as He makes our praise His throne
           C        G/D             G
Behold the Lord our God will lead us home.
