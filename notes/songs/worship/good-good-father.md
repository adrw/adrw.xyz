[Intro]
G  Gsus4  G   (x2)


[Verse 1]
     G           Gsus4    G
Oh, I've heard a thousand stories
G            Gsus4       G
Of what they think You're like
G                   Gsus4  G
But, I've heard the tender whisper
G              Gsus4   G
Of love in the dead of night
         C      G/B
And You tell me that You're pleased
         Am7         D   Dsus4   D
And that I'm never alone


[Chorus]
                    Cadd9
You're a Good, Good Father
                G/B
It's who You are
                Am7
It's who You are
                D
It's who you are
                 Cadd9
And I'm loved by You
             G/B
It's who I am
             Am7
It's who I am
             D   Dsus4   D
It's who I am


[Verse 2]
        G         Gsus4 G
Oh, and I've seen many searching
G           Gsus4   G
For answers far and wide
    G      Gsus4     G
But I know we're all searching
       G         Gsus4 G
For answers only You provide
            C        G/B
‘Cause You know just what we need
       Am7         D   Dsus4
Before we, say a word


[Chorus]
                    Cadd9
You're a Good, Good Father
                G/B
It's who You are
                Am7
It's who You are
                D
It's who you are
                 Cadd9
And I'm loved by You
             G/B
It's who I am
             Am7
It's who I am
             D   Dsus4   D
It's who I am


[Bridge]
                Cadd2                  Em7
‘Cause You are perfect in all of your ways
Am7                     G
Perfect in all of your ways
         Cadd9                  Em7    D
You are perfect in all of Your ways to us
         Cadd9                  Em7
You are perfect in all of your ways
             Am7                   G
Oh, You’re perfect in all of your ways
         Cadd2                  Em7    D
You are perfect in all of Your ways to us


[Verse 3]
           G      Gsus4 G
Oh, it’s a love so un-deniable
G        Gsus4 G
I, I can hardly speak
G        Gsus4  G
Peace so un-explainable
N.C.
I, I can hardly think
        C       G/B
As You call me deeper still
       Am7      G/B
As You call me deeper still
        C       G/B
As You call me deeper still
     Am7          D
Into love, love, love

                G/B
It's who You are
                Am7
It's who You are
                D
It's who you are
                 Cadd9
And I'm loved by You
             G/B
It's who I am
             Am7
It's who I am
             D   Dsus4   D
It's who I am
