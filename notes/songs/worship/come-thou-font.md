[Intro]

[Verse 1]
          G              D
Come Thou Fount of every blessing,
        C        D        G
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
G                        D
Streams of mercy, never ceasing,
         C        D       G
Call for songs of loudest praise.
G       Em             C
Teach me some melodious sonnet,
        Em               C
Sung by flaming tongues above;
           G                 D
Praise the mount!  I'm fixed upon it,
D        C     D       G
Mount of Thy redeeming love.

[Verse 2]
       G              D
Here I raise my "Ebenezer";
        C        D          G
Hither by Thy help I'm come;
G                    D
And I hope, by Thy good pleasure,
D        C         D      G
Safely to arrive at home.
G        Em             C
Jesus sought me when a stranger,
            Em              C
Wandering from the fold of God;
           G                 D
He, to rescue me from danger,
D        C     D       G
Interposed His precious blood.

[Verse 3]
       G                 D
Oh, to grace how great a debtor,
      C       D          G
Daily I'm constrained to be!
G                         D
Let Thy goodness, like a fetter,
        C         D        G
Bind my wand'ring heart to Thee.
G        Em              C
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,
          Em             C
Prone to leave the God I love;
          G                 D
Here's my heart, Oh, take and seal it,
D        C       D      G
Seal it for Thy courts above.

          G              D
Come Thou Fount of every blessing,
        C        D        G
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
G                        D
Streams of mercy, never ceasing,
         C        D       G
Call for songs of loudest praise.
G       Em             C
Teach me some melodious sonnet,
        Em               C
Sung by flaming tongues above;

Here's my heart, Oh, take and seal it,
D        C       D       G
Seal it for Thy courts above.

Here's my heart, Oh, take and seal it,
D        C       D       G
Seal it for Thy courts above.
