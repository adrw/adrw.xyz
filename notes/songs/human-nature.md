[Verse 1]
F        G    F          G
 Looking out, across the night-time;
F         G                 F   G
 The city winks a sleepless eye.
F         G      F        G
 Hear her voice, shake my window;
F         Em7    Dm7   Gsus4
 Sweet se-ducing sighs.

[Verse 2]
F       G    F        G
 Get me out, into the night-time;
F                 G           F     G
 Four walls won't hold me, to-night.
F        G     F          G
 If this town, is just an apple;
F            Em7    Dm7  G
 Then let me take a bite. (If they say);

[Chorus 1]
F     G    C         C/B      Am    G
 Why? why? Tell them that its human nature.
F     Em7          Dm7             Am
 Why? why? Does he do me that way? (If they say);
F     G    C         C/B      Am    G
 Why? why? Tell them that its human nature.
F     Em7          Dm7             G
 Why? why? Does he do me that way?

[Verse 3]
F        G     F          G
 Reaching out, to touch a stranger;
F         G              F     G
 Electric eyes are every-where.
F         G         F         G
 See that girl; she knows I'm watching,
F              Em7   Dm7   G
 She likes the way I stare. (If they say):

[Chorus 2]
F     G    C         C/B      Am    G
 Why? why? Tell them that its human nature.
F     Em7          Dm7             Am
 Why? why? Does he do me that way? (If they say);
F     G    C         C/B      Am    G
 Why? why? Tell them that its human nature.
F     Em7          Dm7             G
 Why? why? Does he do me that way?

       Dm7             Am
I like livin' this way,
       Dm7             Am, Dm9  Fmaj7 (F/G)
I like lovin' this way.           That way.

F        G      F         G
 Looking out, a-cross the morning,
F           G              F    G
 The city's heart begin to beat.
F         G    F           G
 Reaching out, I touch her shoulder;
F             Em7    Dm7    G
 I'm dreaming of the street. (If they say):

[Chorus 3]
F     G    C         C/B      Am    G
 Why? why? Tell them that its human nature.
F     Em7          Dm7             Am
 Why? why? Does he do me that way? (If they say);
F     G    C  C/B  Am  G
 Why? why?

 Why? why? Ta da da da, cha cha cha cha.

 Why? why?

 Why? why? Does he do me that way? (If they say);


F     G    C  C/B  Am  G
 Why? why?
F     Em7          Dm7             Am
 Why? why? Does he do me that way? (If they say);
F     G    C     C/B    Am    G
 Why? why? Ta da da da, ta da ta da.

 Why? why? Does he do me that way? I like livin' this way.
