Notes from taking [The Seven Day Family course](https://familyteams.com/resources/seven-day-family/).

* The 7 day week is a gift from God
  * Day: The earth rotates once
  * Month: The moon rotates the earth once
  * Year: The earth rotates the sun once
  * Week?
  * The 7-day week isn't astronomically based but is a gift from God, a cycle length that leads to human flourishing
  * Other civilizations (French after 1700s Revolution) have tried different length weeks and they collapse for various reasons
  * "And he said to them, â€œThe Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath." - Jesus, Mark 2:27
* Weekly rhythms have allowed the Pryors to have a household of shalom (peace) despite the chaos and activity that naturally comes from having 5 kids
