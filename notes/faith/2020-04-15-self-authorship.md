## Self Authoring

I purchased Jordan Peterson's Self Authoring program almost 3 years ago and never make it past the first screen.

I am routinely unable to finish what I start, but given the [rave reviews and results from other people who have done the program][npr], I want to give it another shot.

Get the program for yourself at [selfauthoring.com][sa].

## Understand Myself

3 years ago I did complete the Understand Myself Big-5 personality assesment and it has continued to be a report that I come back to in trying to understand myself, my reactions, my tendancies, and other aspects of myself that seem different when compared with others.

Try the assesement for yourself at [understandmyself.com][um].
