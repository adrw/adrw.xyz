Serving Christ involves all our soul, heart, mind; our skills, talents, riches, time; everything we have.

His Kingdom is being built, and we can be part of the building team.

Suzie and I are figuring out how that looks like with respect to being portfolio managers for our own Kingdom Projects Fund. 

# History

Even before we got married, Suzie and I had been talking about what this might look like. When we got married in July 2018, we started setting aside into a dedicated savings account a percentage of income every month to go towards kingdom projects.

# What to fund?

This is a big question. A portfolio manager is judged by what they invest in that determines the fund returns.

For our Kingdom Projects Fund, the concept of Return on Investment (ROI) looks something like, how does every dollar we invest in a project contribute to the Kingdom being built?

* Is there a higher ROI with projects in different countries?
* Do certain projects that require more capital return enough to justify the high cost?
* Are the organizations stewarding resources wisely? Expense ratios? 
* Is the project contributing to cycles of dependency? Is it part of the problem of Toxic Charity?
* Is the project helping bring people to know Christ?

## Resources

* Fields of Gold
* Toxic Charity
* Gregg's book
