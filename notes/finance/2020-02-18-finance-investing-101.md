# Finance and Investing 101

Below are resources that educated and formed my knowledge and understanding of economics, finance, investing, and budgeting.

## Books

* MoneySense Guide to the Perfect Portfolio 2013 (Dan Bortolotti), [review here](https://andrew.fm/blog/books-part-3). Excellent overview assuming little to no prior knowledge of interest rates, time value of money, stocks, bonds, RRSPs, and how to confidently understand personal finance and investing terms and concepts.

## Videos

* [10 Secrets to Achieve Financial Success](https://youtu.be/4a51wQAOGR4) (Anton Kriel, Institute of Trading & former Goldmand Sacs trader).
