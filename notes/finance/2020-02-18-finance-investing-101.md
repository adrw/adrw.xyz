# Finance and Investing 101

Below are resources that educated and formed my knowledge and understanding of economics, finance, investing, and budgeting.

## Books

* MoneySense Guide to the Perfect Portfolio 2013 (Dan Bortolotti)
  * [Review here](https://andrew.fm/blog/books-part-3)
  * [Read here](https://cloud.alexanders.xyz/s/sTSKWL6kSoTD7jW)
  * Excellent overview assuming little to no prior knowledge of interest rates, time value of money, stocks, bonds, RRSPs, and how to confidently understand personal finance and investing terms and concepts
* Venture Deals (Brad Feld)
  * [Read here](https://cloud.alexanders.xyz/s/MtYd9kSejpB8iKq)
  * Great overview from two lawyers of venture capital financing instruments and private company investments
* Adaptive Markets (Andrew W. Lo)
  * [Read here](https://cloud.alexanders.xyz/s/26MA6P2amrSJAAw)
  * Haven't read the full book (fairly academic) but the introduction and first few chapters document succinctly how the commonly spouted assumption that markets (specifically the stock market) are efficient (priced correctly) is verifiably wrong, and how markets are influenced by investor emotions and many other factors. 
  * This realization and thus removing the commong "Efficient Market Hypothesis" assumption, ends up changing and inverting the assumed risk of many investing strategies (some low risk strategies are actually high risk, some high risk are not as high as we think), and explaining why smaller companies with higher information assymetry can be great opportunities given the new allowance that they are not priced efficiently.

## Videos
