Even the one that was \\\"Unregistered\\\" was close, but still not\\nthe way how Jim Croce played it. So after studying old Jim Croce\\nperformances, I got it down perfect. The only thing that people may still\\nhave trouble with this song is the beat and the hammer-ons and pull-offs\\nwhile using the barre chords. But if you either listen to the song or\\nwatch Jim Croce perform it on youtube, then it should be childs play. So\\nafter you have made your final judgement on this tab, please rate and/or\\nleave a comment.\\n\\n\\nChords:\\nG    355433\\nD7   x5453x\\nA7   575655\\nB7   797877\\nC    8-10-10-988\\nD7*  10-12-10-11-10-10\\n\\n\\n[Intro]\\n\\nG D7\\n\\n\\n[Verse 1]\\n\\n               G\\nWell, the south side of Chicago\\n         A7\\nIs the baddest part of town.\\n           B7\\nAnd if you go down there\\n           C                D7 *        C        G  D7\\nYou better just beware of a man name of Leroy Brown.\\n     G\\nNow, Leroy more than trouble,\\n           A7\\nYou see he stand about 'bout six foot four.\\n                 B7                        C\\nAll the downtown ladies call him \\\"treetop lover.\\\"\\n        D7 *     C            G  D7\\nAll the men just call him \\\"sir.\\\"\\n\\n\\n[Chorus]\\n\\n         G\\nAnd he's bad, bad, Leroy Brown,\\n    A7\\nThe baddest man in the whole damn town.\\nB7                      C\\nBadder than old King Kong\\n    D7 *          C          G  D7\\nAnd meaner than a junkyard dog.\\n\\n\\n[Verse 2]\\n\\n     G\\nNow, Leroy, he a gambler,\\n       A7\\nand he like his fancy clothes.\\n       B7           C\\nAnd he like to wave diamond rings\\n            D7 * C      G  D7\\nin front of everybody's nose\\n         G\\nHe got a custom Continental.\\n          A7\\nHe got an Eldorado too.\\n         B7                    C\\nHe got a thirty-two gun in his pocket for fun.\\n         D7 *  C      G    D7\\nHe got a razor in his shoe.\\n\\n\\n[Chorus]\\n\\n         G\\nAnd he's bad, bad, Leroy Brown,\\n    A7\\nThe baddest man in the whole damn town.\\nB7                      C\\nBadder than old King Kong\\n    D7 *          C          G  D7\\nAnd meaner than a junkyard dog.\\n\\n\\n[Verse 3]\\n\\n      G\\nWell, Friday 'bout a week ago,\\nA7\\nLeroy's shootin' dice.\\n           B7                    C\\nAnd at the edge of the bar sat a girl name of Doris\\n    D7 *     C         G   D7\\nand oh, that girl look nice\\n         G\\nWell, he cast his eyes upon her\\n        A7\\nand the trouble soon began.\\n    B7                        C\\nAnd Leroy Brown, he learned a lesson 'bout messin'\\n         D7 *      C       G   D7\\nwith the wife of a jealous man\\n\\n\\n[Chorus]\\n\\n         G\\nAnd he's bad, bad, Leroy Brown,\\n    A7\\nThe baddest man in the whole damn town.\\nB7                      C\\nBadder than old King Kong\\n    D7 *          C          G  D7\\nAnd meaner than a junkyard dog.\\n\\n\\n[Verse 4]\\n\\n          G\\nWell, the two men took to fightin'\\n              A7\\nAnd when they pulled them from the floor,\\nB7                  C                    D7 *      C      G    D7\\nLeroy looked like a jigsaw puzzle with a couple of pieces gone.\\n\\n\\n[Chorus] (x2)\\n\\n         G\\nAnd he's bad, bad, Leroy Brown,\\n    A7\\nThe baddest man in the whole damn town.\\nB7                      C\\nBadder than old King Kong\\n    D7 *          C          G  D7\\nAnd meaner than a junkyard dog.\\n\\n(At the end of the second chorus, don't play the D7.
