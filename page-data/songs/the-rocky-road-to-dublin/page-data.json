Leave where I was born\\nCut a stout blackthorn,  To banish ghosts and goblin\\nBought a pair of brogues,  Rattle over the bogs\\nFrightened all the dogs,  On the rocky road to Dublin\\n\\nOne, Two, Three, Four, Five\\nHunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road\\nAnd all the ways to Dublin, Whack fol la de da\\n\\nWhen in Mullingar that night,  I rested limbs so weary\\nStarted by daylight, Me spirits bright and early\\nTook a drop o' pure, Keep me heart from sinking\\nThat's a paddy's cure,  Whenever he's on drinking\\nTo see the lassie's smile,  Laughing all the while\\nAt me curious style,   Would set your heart to bubbling\\nAsked me I was hired, Wages I required\\nI was almost tired, On the rocky road to Dublin\\n\\nOne, Two, Three, Four, Five\\nHunt the hare and turn her down

All among the quality\\nMe bundle it was stole,  In a neat locality\\nSomething crossed me mind,  When I looked behind\\nNo bundle could I find,  Upon me stick a wobbling\\nEnquiring after the rogue,

A cabin found for Paddy\\nDown among the pigs,  Played some hearty rigs\\nDanced some hearty jigs,  The water round me bubblin'\\nWhen off Holyhead,  I wished meself was dead\\nOr, Better far instead,

we safely landed\\nCalled meself a fool,  I could no longer stand it\\nBlood began to boil,  Temper I was losing\\nPoor ould Erins Isle,  They began abusing\\nHurrah me soul says I,    Shillelagh I let fly\\nSome Galway boys were by,  Saw I was a-hollerin'\\nThen with a loud horray,  They joined in the affray\\nWe quickly cleared the way,  For the rocky road to Dublin\\n\\nOne, Two, Three, Four,
