To the Christian, the prospect of death serves to emphasize the emptiness and fleetingness of earthly pleasures, luxuries, and achievements, and thus also as an invitation to focus one's thoughts on the prospect of the afterlife. A Biblical injunction often associated with the memento mori in this context is In omnibus operibus tuis memorare novissima tua, et in aeternum non peccabis (the Vulgate's Latin rendering of Ecclesiasticus 7:40, \\\"in all thy works be mindful of thy last end and thou wilt never sin.\\\")\")), mdx(\"blockquote\", null, mdx(\"p\", {\n    parentName: \"blockquote\"\n  }, \"Timepieces were formerly an apt reminder that your time on Earth grows shorter with each passing minute.

Even today, clocks often carry the motto tempus fugit, \\\"time flees\\\". Old striking clocks often sported automata who would appear and strike the hour; some of the celebrated automaton clocks from Augsburg, Germany had Death striking the hour. The several computerized \\\"death clocks\\\" revive this old idea. Private people carried smaller reminders of their own mortality.
